<h2>THE OLD CORPORATION.</h2>


<p>Those words "odd," and "singular," and "eccentric,"
what odd, singular, eccentric sort of words
they are, reader! How often they mean nothing,&mdash;being
thrown out, as descriptions of character, by
drivelling Ignorance, who scrapes them up as the
dregs,&mdash;the mere siftings left at the bottom of his
vocabulary, when he has expended his scant collection
of more definite images-in-syllables. And how
much more often are they affixed to the memories of
the living or dead, who have been real brothers among
men, and have thus earned these epithets from jaundiced
envy, or guilty selfishness, or heartless pride
and tyranny. How little it commends to us, either
our common nature, or such corrupt fashioning as
ages of wrong have given it, that, if we would become
acquainted with a truly good man,&mdash;a being
to love and to knit the heart unto,&mdash;we must seek
for him among the class of character which the
world&mdash;woe worth it!&mdash;calls "odd," or "singular,"
or "eccentric!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet so it is, the best of mankind, those, most veritably,
"of whom the world was not worthy," have been,
in their day, either the butt for the sneers of silliness,
or the object of envy's relentless hate, or they have
toiled and toiled, perhaps unto martyrdom, beneath
the withering, blasting frown of pride and oppression.
Ay, and let us be honest with ourselves, and confess,
that though years or hard experience may have bettered
our own natures,&mdash;for we are all too much like
that kind of fruit which takes long days and many
weathers to ripen it, so as to bring forth its most
wholesome flavour,&mdash;let us be honest, I say, with
ourselves, and confess, that we were as foolishly
willing as others, in our youth, to laugh at what
the varlet world calls oddness, and singularity,
and eccentricity. Some of us, however, now see
matters in a somewhat different light. We have discovered
that there is some marrow of meaning in
many of those old saws we once thought so tiresome
and dry,&mdash;such as, "All is not gold that glitters,"
and, "Judge not a nut by the shell," and the like;
and we say, within ourselves, when we are in a
moralising mood, (as you and I are now, reader,) that,
if we were young again, we would not join the world
in laughing as we used to laugh with it, at certain
queer folk who dwell in our memories,&mdash;for we begin
to have a shrewd suspicion that they were among the
true "diamonds in the rough" of human character.</p>

<p>And, to be truly candid with ourselves, reader,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
have not you and I found out, by this time, that
we are, to all intents and purposes, as "odd," and
as "singular," and as "eccentric," as other folk?
Is not the jewel of the truth this,&mdash;as pointless
as the saying may look at first sight,&mdash;that&mdash;All
men are singular? Hath not every man his likes
and his dislikes, his whims and his caprices, his
fancies and his hobbies, his faults and his failings?
And are not these found so strangely interwoven in
our daily thinkings, and sayings, and doings, that
they may well make observers ponder upon them,
if they had not enough of similar employment at
home? Nay, if some one unnatural sort of thought,
or impression, or habit, which each of us have,
could be seen, at all times, by every body, in its
true dimensions, would it not look as uncouth as
one of those huge boulders of primary rock tumbled
down from the mass, and left sticking out from
some late-formed strata of marl, quite at a distance
from its proper place, that the geologists talk of?
Would not the thought, or impression, or habit, if
our most attached friends could see it in its proper
moral bulk, dwarf many of our "excellencies," as
their partiality phrases it, and really render us poor
deformed things, in their judgment?</p>

<p>"What, then, do ye mean to preach us into the
belief that it is a crime for us ever to have a hearty,
harmless laugh, at a queer fellow when we chance
to see him?" Not exactly so, my lads; but we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
ought never to forget that we are queer fellows
ourselves. Nor ought we to fail in the reflection
that, if we were fully acquainted with that queer
fellow, it might happen we should discover him to
be of infinitely more moral value than ten thousand
of the smooth-trimmed estimables in the eye of the
world, who conform to all its precepts so obediently
that they never anger it. And, much more, if we
know enough of the "queer fellow" to be aware
that a true, warm, glowing, fraternal heart for his
fellow-creatures beats in his bosom, notwithstanding
a few outward traits of somewhat striking difference
from the crowd, why, then, it becomes our
bounden duty,&mdash;I will not say, never to smile at
his peculiarities, for that sort of puritanism will not
make us better men,&mdash;but to dwell upon his virtues
and excellencies,&mdash;to extol them, yea, to enthrone
them, whenever he is seen, or heard, or talked of,
by those with whom we company.</p>

<p>Perhaps political party is more universal than
any other bad influence without, in misguiding
Englishmen into ill-natured, or contemptuous, or
depreciatory judgments of their neighbours and fellow-townsmen.
The last dozen or fifteen years,
especially, have engendered a superabundance of this
foul canker;&mdash;so many new rivalries have sprung
up with the great changes in political and municipal
institutions; and men, from the mightiest to
the meanest, have been caught up, and whirled along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
in many instances so involuntarily, into the rush and
torrent of change. And yet, how the lapse of these
dozen or fifteen years hath altered the judgment
of many of us, with regard to some men and their
party-cries. What a wide-spread "liberal" laudation,
for instance, there was about the famous definition
of a Tory, in the <i>Times</i>,&mdash;and yet how
soon it became its own "duck-legged drummer-boy,"
and all that! Nay, how soon did some of
the very chiefs of the potential reforming party,&mdash;from
idols of the multitude,&mdash;by their refusal to
complete what they had begun, and, indeed, in
some instances, by their open manifestation of a
will to undo what they had done,&mdash;become its scoff
and scorn, nay, even its detestation!</p>

<p>And then the old "Guilds," or "Corporations," to
which the new "Town-Councils" have succeeded,&mdash;what
a general tendency to exaggeration there was
in the mode of judging of them, and in the tone of
talking and writing about them, especially in the
public prints. How witty were the newspaper people
in their conceits of conserving, or pickling, or embalming
an alderman, and having him placed in the
British Museum, as a curiosity for antiquaries to
form profound speculations upon, some ten or twelve
centuries into futurity! Ay, and how eloquently
abusive was the prevailing Whig strain about "nests
of corruption," and "rotten lumber," and "fine
pickings," and "impositions, and frauds, and dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
rogueries of the self-elect!" And how the scale has
turned, since, in the greater share of boroughs, where
the poor and labouring classes threw up their hats
for joy at "municipal reform,"&mdash;and now mutter
discontent at the pride of upstarts become insolent
oppressors,&mdash;or openly curse, as in the poverty-stricken
and hunger-bitten manufacturing districts, at the relentless
and grinding tyrannies of the recreant middle-classes
whom municipal honours have drawn off from
their hot-blooded radicalism, and converted into cold,
unfeeling, merciless wielders of magisterial or other
local power.</p>

<p>There was, it cannot be denied, in the droll trappings
and antiquated mummeries of the old guilds,&mdash;in
their ermined scarlet cloaks, and funny cocked
hats, and in their maces and staves,&mdash;and above all,
in the starch, and march, and swelling, and strut, and
pomposity, with which these were worn or borne,&mdash;much
that was calculated to tickle the spectator into
mirth; but, really, when one thinks of it, are the
horse-hair wig of a bishop, a judge, or a barrister, the
robe and coronet of a peer, or the crown and sceptre
of a king or queen, less like playthings for upgrown
children than were the "regalia" and antique habits
of the old corporation-men? Was Cromwell so far
beside the mark when he called the Speaker's mace a
"fool's bauble?"&mdash;and might not the expression be
applied with as much fitness to many other "ensigns
of office," as they are called?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>And again: though it is true that a grand uncurtaining
of robbery,&mdash;for that is the plain English of
it,&mdash;was made in some, at least, of the old boroughs,
by the inquest of that parliamentary commission
which preceded the sweeping away of the old corporations,&mdash;yet
are we not, now, become conscious,
that amid the party heat and animosity of the period,
much private excellence was over-shaded or forgotten
in the rage of public censure, nay, that much virtue
was denied, even where it was known to exist, lest
the recognition of it should mar the scheme for overthrowing
the party to which that virtue was attached?</p>

<p>This is a long exordium for a fugitive sketch, and
it is time to say it has sprung from reflections created
in the mind of an imprisoned "conspirator" and
"mover of sedition," by the flitting across his cell, in
his imagination, of sundry bygone shapes with whom
he was, more or less, familiar at one period of his
changeful life. It is the "Old Corporation" of the
ancient and time-honoured city of Lincoln, of which
the writer speaks;&mdash;and though wit might discover
among its members many a foible that would form
a picture to "make those laugh whose lungs are
tickled o' the sere," yet generosity, and justice, no
less, must confess, that after the most searching inquiry
and exposure, they were neither individually
nor collectively stained with the acts of peculation
and embezzlement, nor application of public funds to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
political party purposes, which were so heavily, and,
no doubt, truly charged on some of the old guilds in
other parts of the country.</p>

<p>Yet they were, as a body, supporters of the <i>ancien
régime</i>, as was natural: they had been inured, the
greater part of them, through nearly the whole of
their lives, to look upon the established state of
things as the best and fittest;&mdash;and, no doubt, the
majority of them conscientiously believed it to be so,&mdash;failing,
through the confined and stinted nature
of their social training, to reflect that what was
productive to themselves, the few, of pleasure or
comfort, might confer no benefits on the many,&mdash;but
rather be a source, to these, of deep and increasing
suffering. Passing by many a picture that starts to
memory of "mayoralty," and its ludicrous airs of
greatness, and many a reminiscence of grave joke
and lighter whimsicality,&mdash;of burlesque importance,
and mirth-moving earnestness about trifles,&mdash;recollection
dwells with consolated interest on more
durable limnings of simple, uncorrupted manners,
and warm hearts, and really expansive natures, that
belonged to some of that "Old Corporation."</p>

<p>There is one comes before me, vividly, at this
moment,&mdash;while that sweet robin-red-breast hops
into my day-room, and bends his neck to look at me
so knowingly and friendlily in my loneliness, as he
doth, almost daily;&mdash;and the loved bird's image consorts
delightfully with him I was thinking of,&mdash;for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
above all things, the fine, noble-hearted, yet meek
and gentle old alderman, loved to be thought and
esteemed an <i>ornithologist</i>! That was his pride, his
loftiest aim, his highest ambition,&mdash;as far as reputation
or a name was the subject of his thought. As
for his charities, and enlarged acts of sympathy for
his suffering fellow-creatures, his deeds of mercy and
goodness, he strove to hide them, performing them
often by stealth, and half denying the performance
of them, when admiration of his beneficence kindled
praise of it in his hearing. Ah! it is too true: he
relieved wretchedness till his purse was scanty, and
his circumstances were straitened;&mdash;and then,&mdash;and
then,&mdash;in spite of his aldermanic dignity, in spite of
his "respectable" family connections, and even the
respectability of his own practice and profession, as a
surgeon,&mdash;he was mentioned as the "odd,"&mdash;the
"singular,"&mdash;the "eccentric" Mr. &mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>That</i> is the world. Who would have dreamt that
Alderman&mdash;&mdash;was odd, or singular, or eccentric,
had he kept his money, instead of giving it to the
distressed?</p>

<p>But the kind-hearted old man thirsted for reputation
as an <i>ornithologist</i>. Well, and in good sooth, he had
some solid claim to it. Birds were his passion; and
you seldom met any one who knew so much about
them. I know not whether his relatives keep the
book of drawings which the good man showed to me,
as he had showed it to hundreds, with so much in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>nocent
pride;&mdash;taking care to relate how it had been
begun when he was a young apprentice, and had
taken him years to complete; above all, that it was
the product of early hours stolen from sleep, and had
never robbed, his professional duties of their proper
share of attention. They ought to keep it, however,
and to value it too. Not for the sake of any surpassing
excellence in the portraitures of birds with
which it was filled; for, although the good old man
was so proud of the "<i>real</i> birds," which he used to
observe it contained, yet they were embodied to
the eye somewhat in Chinese taste, as clearly as
I can remember: rather with exactitude of pencillings
and shades, than with skill in the "drawing"
or attitude of the bird, or observance of rules of perspective,
or "fore-shortening," or any of the intricacies
of art. But the heart&mdash;the heart of the good
man whose hand performed these curious and laborious
limnings&mdash;should stamp a precious value on the
book that contained them.</p>

<p>Nor was it a mere unmeaning hobby, this love of
the feathered tribe which was so strong in the benevolent
alderman. He was another Gilbert White in
diligence of observation on their habits in the woods
and fields, and on the heath and the moor. In his
rural rides as a surgeon, he was ever learning some
fact relative to their economy, and he most diligently
chronicled it. And at the return of the season, he
was as punctually periodical as the fall of the leaf in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
acquainting his friendly circle with his impressions
relative to the severity or the openness of the ensuing
winter, from his observations on the feathered
tribe. Many of these "prognostications," as some
people called them, although he never assumed the
character of a prophet himself, were registered in
the <i>Stamford Mercury</i>, the long-established and
ably-conducted medium of information for the extensive
though thinly-peopled district of Lincolnshire;
and they so seldom failed to be realised, that
the ornithological surgeon was often complimented
on his prophecies. "Nay," he would reply, "I am
no prophet: I only go by Nature's books: you may
do the same, if you'll read them."</p>

<p>Was it his diligent and loving perusal of these
books which imbued him with that never-failing zeal
to relieve the miserable? was it by his continued
drinking of the lessons of bounty and care discoverable
in those books, that kept open, to his latest day,
the sluices of his beneficent heart,&mdash;so that the icy
influences of the world never froze them up,&mdash;but
they were left to well out goodness, and tenderness,
and pity, for the poor, and hungry, and sick, and
miserable, to the end of his life?</p>

<p>One cannot suppress a persuasion of this kind;
and it seems next to impossible but that Gilbert
White must have gladdened the poor of his "Selborne,"
to the very extent of his means, and, perhaps,
sometimes beyond it,&mdash;secretly, humbly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
unobtrusively,&mdash;while his amiable mind was displaying
so simply and charmingly, in that correspondence
with Tennant and Barrington, its devoted love and
admiration of the characters in "Nature's books."
This thought may be but a prejudice of the imagination;
but such prejudices are less criminal than the
prejudices of the judgment or understanding, and
one feels unwilling to have them removed in a case
like this: we have, alas! too many examples of evil
contradictions in the characters we thirst to love,&mdash;and
our worship even of the noblest intelligences,&mdash;such
as Bacon,&mdash;is too often checked by them.</p>

<p>In the devoted reader of "Nature's books," however,
of whom we are immediately speaking, there
was a delightful harmony of character. "I cannot
pay you, yet, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,"&mdash;said a poor woman to him,
as I walked by his side, along the High Street of
St. Botolph's parish, listening to his autumnal chronicle,&mdash;"I
cannot pay you yet, sir, for my husband
is out of work."&mdash;"Pr'ythee, never mind, woman,"
replied the good man. "Make thyself easy, and
get that poor boy a pair of shoes, before thou pays
me!"&mdash;"God bless you, sir!" replied the poor woman,
with her ragged and shoeless lad, and dropped
a courtesy, while the grateful tear rolled down her
cheek. I looked, with an impulse of admiration, at
the face of the good alderman, as we passed along,
and the tears were coursing each other adown his
face likewise!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>And how often have I heard,&mdash;what, indeed, well-nigh
every citizen of old Lincoln had either heard, or
witnessed,&mdash;of his bounteous relief of famishing and
clotheless families he was called to attend during the
sickness of a child or father, or the mother's agony
of Nature. One thought presents itself painfully: it
is, that while he manifested so true a fraternity with
man, and lived a life of so much private, unobtrusive
blessing,&mdash;he was so frequently the victim of encroaching
and designing knaves. His ready loans of
money, in his wealthiest days, to needy tradesmen,
were often punctually and honestly returned; but he
was too often victimised. And there is one image
now crosses me, very legibly,&mdash;that used to haunt
and pester the good-hearted man, even up to the
period of his straitness,&mdash;ever goading him with
some plea of difficulty, and essaying to squeeze out
of him another sum, under the unprincipled name
of a loan. He was a "limb of the law," who had
been "done up" in his profession, for his want of
honesty. And yet I have some misgivings whether
that human being were so morally culpable as his
life of shuffle, and deceit, and meanness, would lead
one to think; for I remember how often I noticed
the large indentation across his bald head, caused by
some accident, in which the bone of the skull had
been bent or broken, and, consequently, the brain
injured. His career is at an end, however; and
whatever might be the true solution of the problem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of his idiosyncrasy, one cannot help feeling a regret
that the best and finest natures should so often,
in this world, become a prey to the worst,&mdash;as in
the case of this vile practiser, who often boasted over
his brandy, in the presence of some base associate,
that he had gulled the alderman again!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Memory calls up another form less distinctly, since
it belonged to one who was much nearer the end of
his course; and the impression of his identity depends
more on what others said of him than on
any thing like personal or intimate acquaintance with
his character. From some unskilfulness of speech,
or want of grace in outward demeanour, or some other
mark that the world thought "odd," or "singular,"
or "eccentric," he had gained the odd, singular, and
eccentric, but very distinctive <i>soubriquet</i> of Alderman
Lob. He was a bulky sort of man externally, talked
thick, yet talked a great deal; was laid up with the
gout often, and passed his closing years totally within
doors as an invalid: but many a poverty-stricken
habitant of Lincoln found weekly relief at his door;
and more than one aged and infirm creature prayed
for the lengthening out of his life, in the fear they
would be left destitute, or be compelled to go into
the workhouse, when they could no longer depend on
his weekly charity.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The master-spirit of that old guild, though too
mentally acute, and too successful in the acquirement
of wealth to leave room for the world to term him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
odd, or singular, or eccentric, united in his composition
some high qualities that now rise in kindly
answer to the record memory gives of the bitter
things spoken of him by party. He had been the
"town-clerk" of the guild, and even then wielded
the principal power in it, being really its master,
though nominally its servant; and only laid aside
the black gown and quill to don an alderman's ermined
cloak, because he had become too wealthy
either to desire longer to reap the salary, or undergo
the fatigue and labour of his first office.</p>

<p>His attention to every man in whom he discerned
superior ability, without regard to conventional grade,
and often in defiance of its rules; his real liberality in
giving aid to honest industry, wherever he found it;
his munificence in assisting either the "charities"
which are the just pride of old Lincoln, or any plan
for presenting its citizens with amusement that combined
usefulness: these were among his life-long
acts. And, in spite of the keen raillery with which
his shrewd penetration of character often led him to
visit the vulgar conceit or affectation of some with
whom his office brought him into frequent contact,
all bore testimony to his intelligence and honour.
Nay, although he was one who never professed any
fervid sympathy with popular progress, and therefore
was not likely to become a favourite with a people so
strongly political as the Lincoln cits were a few years
ago, yet so deeply did they regard him as a man who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
by the excellence of his understanding, had done
honour to their city in bearing one of its chief offices,
that a general and reverential sorrow was expressed
when his end approached, for it was seen, in his
wasted frame and fading eye, many months before
the fatal moment came.</p>

<p>Perhaps their knowledge of the one bitter draught
that was mingled with his life's chalice, during the
concluding years of his course, served greatly to
soften their thoughts towards the intellectual chief
of the old municipal institution, even while many of
them rejoiced at the overthrow of the institution itself.
His tenderly beloved and highly accomplished
daughter,&mdash;his only child,&mdash;faded and died; and,
therewith, the charm of life seemed broken for him.
How often was this a subject of kindly-spirited converse
among citizens as he passed; and how reflectingly
did they note what they learnt to be his own
poignant observations on that heart-rending bereavement!&mdash;his
pithy and thrilling confessions that he
had toiled for nothing!&mdash;that life was only a scene
of disappointment!&mdash;that he had used unceasing exertion
to attain wealth; but he had, now, neither
"chick nor child" to leave it to! So fertile is life
in affording moral nurture and correction to all
hearts!&mdash;creating sympathy with the sorrowful brother,
with him to whom the bitter cup is appointed;
but infusing a salutary admonition, meanwhile, not
to set our hearts too passionately on things of clay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
lest we doom ourselves also to drink of that bitterness!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He who was esteemed the most "odd," the most
"singular," the most "eccentric" member of that
Old Corporation, lingered long after its demise; and
by the popularity of his character, as the only radical
alderman of the Old, became a town councillor,
and eventually a mayor, under the New municipal
institution. How rife were the stories of his furious
attacks upon the "self-elect" of the olden time!&mdash;and
what a rich hue of the burlesque was thrown
around the pictures that were given of him in daily
conversation! Yet, who did not, in spite of his slenderness
of intellect, love him for his incorruptible
honesty, and, above all, for his unfailing benevolence?
Oh! there was not a human being,&mdash;beggar,
pauper, distressed stranger, or townsman,&mdash;who ever
went from his door unrelieved; nor could he pass,
in the street, a fellow-creature whose appearance led
him to suppose he had found a real sufferer, but
he must inquire into it, even unsolicited. The abhorrent
enactments of the New Poor Law,&mdash;how
he hated them!&mdash;and how staggered he felt in his
reforming faith, when the "liberal" administration
urged the passing of the strange Malthusian measure!
"I cannot understand it!" he would exclaim, in the
hearing of the numerous participants in his English
hospitality; "I never thought that Reform was to
make the poor more miserable, and the poorest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the poor the most miserable: it is a mystery to
me! Surely it is a mistake in Lord Grey and Lord
Brougham!" So the good old man thought and
said; but he did not live to see the "liberal" lawmakers
either correct their mistake, or acknowledge
that they had made one,&mdash;though agonised thousands
pealed that sad truth in their ears!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<h2>NED WILCOM;</h2>

<p class="center">A STORY OF
A FATHER'S SACRIFICE OF HIS CHILD
AT THE
SHRINE OF MAMMON.</p>


<p>"Sirrah! you have nothing to do but to get on in
the world. You <i>may</i> do that, if you will. The
way is open for you, as it was for me; so get up
to London, and try. There's twenty pounds for
you: I'll give you twenty thousand, as soon as you
show me one thousand of your own; but I won't
give you another farthing till you prove to me that
you know the value of money, and can get it yourself.
And mark me, sir! if you haven't the nouse
to make something out in the world, you shall live
and die a beggar, for me; for I'll leave all I have to
your sisters, and cut you off with a shilling. There,
sir! there's your road! Good morning!"</p>

<p>And so saying, Mr. Ned Wilcom, senior, pushed
Mr. Ned Wilcom, junior, his only son, out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
counting-house, and shut the door upon him. That
was an awkward way for a rich Leeds merchant to
receive a son on the completion of his apprenticeship
as a draper, and at the early age of twenty. Yet it
was no worse than young Ned expected. Nor did it
break his heart, as it would have broken the heart
of a lad who had been more tenderly nurtured. Ned
Wilcom never saw his father occupied with any
other thought, act, employ, or pleasure, but what
pertained to money-getting; nor ever heard his
father pass an encomium on any human character in
his life, save on such as succeeded in piling together
large fortunes from small beginnings, or enriched
themselves by outwitting their neighbours. From
the age of nine to sixteen, he had only seen his
father twice a year&mdash;Midsummer and Christmas; and
having lost his mother when a mere infant, he never
knew or felt the softening influences of maternal
affection. The artificial life of a boarding-school,
during those seven years, infused a good deal of
craft, and nearly as large a measure of heartlessness,
into Ned's nature&mdash;for it was not originally of such
tendencies. The master and ushers were hypocrites
and tyrants, only differing in grade; and if there
were a lad with a little more gentleness, humanity,
and openness about him than the rest, Ned observed
that he soon "went to the wall" among his school-fellows.
And so, with one influence or other, Ned
Wilcom left school with the firm persuasion that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
world was a general battle-field, where the weak and
the virtuous were destined to become the prey of
the strong and the crafty; and, all things considered,
Ned resolved to take sides with the winning party.</p>

<p>Such were Ned's resolves at sixteen; and they
were by no means changed in their direction, or
weakened in their vigour, by an apprenticeship in a
dashing and aspiring draper's shop in Liverpool
during the succeeding four years. To that sea-port
he was accompanied, per coach, by his father; whose
parting words then were, that he was to remember
that "he was going to be taught how to make money,
the only thing worth learning;" and, until he received
the summary benediction already rehearsed,
Ned did not see his father again. It is true, he
received from home a half-yearly letter, but it never
harped on more than one string, and that was the
old one; so that, drawing his inferences from these
premises, Ned Wilcom was not surprised to be dismissed
in five minutes, with twenty pounds, and to
have the counting-house door shut in his face by his
own father.</p>

<p>Within a week after his arrival in London, Ned
Wilcom found a situation; and it was one to his
heart's content&mdash;as he told his father in a letter of
five lines, for he knew his parent too well to trouble
him with a longer epistle. The lad's ambition could
only have been more highly gratified by a reception
into the establishment of Swan and Edgar, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Quadrant, or the superb "Waterloo House" in
Cockspur Street, for he had obtained a place in that
immensest of show-shops which attracts the stranger
crowds in St. Paul's Churchyard, where the business
was of a less select nature than in the two rival
first-rate shops at the West End, and was therefore
a more fitting field for the exercise of such knowledge
and tact as Ned had acquired in Liverpool.
And all went on exceedingly well with Ned for
several weeks. It is true, the discipline of the
establishment was somewhat more rigorous than in
the house he had quitted; but he was prepared to
expect it. He was compelled to "look sharp about
him;" but he had heard in the country that that
would be the case. The matter of vianding, the
exact minute of remaining out in the evening, the
amount of exertion and energy in discharging his
duties, all was so exactly defined, measured, and
timed, that to a mere raw apprentice from the
country, or to one whose mind was less determinately
girt up to make his way, the situation would have
seemed any thing but pleasant. Ned, however, felt
quite at home, for he had yoked his will to his
necessities; and in lieu of indulging the slightest disposition
to grumble at his lot, set success before himself,
and determined to achieve it. With a mind so
fully made up, a handsome figure, a winning address,
and a fair portion of natural shrewdness, Ned was
sure to conduct himself in such a way as to please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
his employers. In fact, in the course of a dozen or
fifteen weeks, he became the decided favourite with
the manager of the concern, and, of course, experienced
proportionate pecuniary advancement.</p>

<p>But a woeful change awaited Ned Wilcom, despite
these fair prospects. His eagerness to succeed had
urged him to stretch his powers beyond their
strength, and his resolve to economise, so as to win
the means of early independence, induced him to
deny himself too rigidly of under-clothing, and the
consequence was, that a nervous lassitude and a
severe cold at once attacked him. He bore up some
days; but was a little shocked to observe a change
of look in the manager, and to overhear a little
whispering by way of comment on his lack of energy.
Five days had passed; but on the morning of the
sixth, it was with extreme difficulty he rose from
bed, and so lethargic were his faculties, that he felt
it utterly impossible to put on appearances of excessive
complaisance, or to display the customary
grimaces of civility. Towards noon, excessive pains
in the head and chest drove him from the shop; and,
without saying a word to any one, he sought his
sleeping-room, and threw himself on his bed. Here
he was found in a state of insensibility, in the course
of half an hour was undressed, and put into bed.
Ned refused the cool offers of extra diet made him,
when he came to his senses; and when visited by
the manager, said he had no doubt he would be quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
well by the next morning. The manager elevated
his brows, said he hoped so, and walked away immediately.</p>

<p>When the morning came, however, the youth was
so weak that he felt he would be utterly incapable of
exertion if he went down stairs; yet he would have
attempted it, had not one who had been much longer
in the establishment than himself&mdash;though Ned had
passed him by, in preferment&mdash;stepped into his bed-room,
and most pressingly persuaded him not to think
of going down. So Ned put off his half resolve to
go down, and threw himself again on the bed. But
what was his surprise, grief, and disgust, on seeing
this very individual step again into his room in the
course of five minutes, to announce with the most
marble coldness of look, that the manager desired
Mr. Wilcom would get up and make out his account&mdash;for
it was against rule for any one to remain on the
establishment who was unable to attend to business.
"Immediately," was the only word the messenger
added, turning back as he was about to quit the
room, and then departing with a wicked sneer upon
his face. Poor Ned! he felt he was in a hard case;
but his native pride was too great to permit him to
weep, or give way. Indignation strung his nerves
for the nonce; he bounced up&mdash;dressed himself&mdash;though
he trembled like one in the palsy&mdash;made out
his account&mdash;went down stairs, and presented it&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
paid, by the manager's order&mdash;and quitted the premises,
in the lapse of fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Occupied with the vengeful feeling that was natural
after such cruel treatment&mdash;though it was but an
every-day fact, with drapers' assistants, in London&mdash;the
youth had arrived in Fleet Street ere he bethought
him that he had left his clothes behind him, and had
not made up his mind as to where he was going.
Faintness began to come over him, and he was compelled
to cling to a window for support. Two passengers
on the causeway stopped, and began to
address him sympathetically; the rest of the living
stream swept on, without staying to notice him. A
cabman, however, less from sympathy than from the
hope of employ, speedily brought his vehicle to the
edge of the slabs, and jumping from his seat with the
reins in his hand, asked if he could be of any service
to the gentleman. Ned felt it was not a time for
prolonged consideration, and earnestly, though feebly,
desired the cabman to convey him to some decent
boarding-house. One of the persons supporting him
saw that his state did not permit questioning, and
prevented the cabman's asking where he would be
driven to, by telling the man to proceed at once to a
number he mentioned in Bolt Court. The same individual
walked by the side of the cab, for the little way
that it was to the entry of the court, and then helped
to support Ned to the house. A sick man, however,
was not likely to meet with a very hearty welcome in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
a London boarding-house; and, in spite of the entreaties
of the person who accompanied him, the youth
would have had the door shut upon him, had he not
roused all his remaining vigour, and assured the keeper
of the establishment, not only that he would soon be
well, but that he was able to pay for what he might
need. With such assurances he was reluctantly received,
and supported up stairs to a bed-room. Presence
of mind served him to give order for fetching
his portmanteau from the establishment he had just
quitted; and it was well that it was so, for he became
insensible almost immediately. A fever ensued of
some weeks' continuance; and, at the end of it, when
Ned regained his consciousness, he found himself
reduced to a state of emaciation, and under medical
attendance, with a deeply reduced purse.</p>

<p>These were concomitants of a nature to bring great
pain to the mind of one like Ned Wilcom; and it was
with a severe struggle that he shut out despair, and
encouraged himself to believe that, though so grievously
frustrated in his commencing hopes of independence,
the prospect of success would again bud,
and finally blossom. After ascertaining from his
physician that his state would bear a removal to a less
expensive lodging, Ned wrote home to his father, and
informed him of his unfortunate condition, and of
what had led to it. Mr. Wilcom, senior, was a little
surprised to receive a second letter from his son so
soon, for "he had no notion," as he used to say, "of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
lads perpetually writing home, like unweaned babies
that wanted pap;" and he, therefore, broke the seal
of poor Ned's letter with no remarkable degree of
good humour. The length of the letter, when opened,
caused the money-getting father to throw it aside
with an indescribable curl of the lip and nose, and a
loud "Pshaw!"&mdash;and that was all the attention the
poor youth's epistle received for the five next succeeding
days, that is to say, until Sunday came, and
the merchant thought he had time to look at it. The
next morning Ned Wilcom received his father's
answer: it was simply&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Sir,</p>

<p>"Yours came to hand last Monday. If your
illness was brought on by want of caution, it ought
to teach you prudence. If you have been unlucky,
you are only like many more; and, as your grandfather
used to say, the best way and the manliest,
with troubles, is to grin and abide by them. Wish
you better.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your humble servant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<span class="smcap">Edward Wilcom</span>, senior.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The letter dropped from Ned's hand like a lump of
lead too heavy to hold. With all his knowledge of
his father's nature and habits, he had not expected
this. Indeed, Ned's uninterrupted good health,
through the whole of his brief space of life, had pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>vented
the possibility of his testing his father's
tenderness before. For some hours, the youth experienced
misery he had never known till then; and
was so completely paralysed with the sense of his
wretched and deserted state, that the physician, who
made his usual call in the afternoon, could obtain no
intelligent answer to his questions; and though by
no means one whose heart overflowed with the milk
of human kindness, felt constrained, in a sympathising
tone, to ask if any thing extraordinary had occurred
to his patient. Ned pointed to the letter which lay
on the floor, and in spite of the hardness of feeling
into which he had trained himself, burst into a
flood of tears.</p>

<p>Nature was thus sufficiently relieved to enable the
youth to answer the physician's inquiries as to his
father's wealth, habits, and so on, with a slight but
very significant additional query as to the extent of
Ned's remaining stock of money. The conclusion
was <i>not</i> any promise of help, but cool advice to
remove, forthwith, to a cheaper lodging; or which,
the physician remarked, would be far more prudent,
to an hospital. The latter alternative Ned could
not brook <i>then</i>, so he did remove to a cheaper
lodging; but his feebleness disappeared so slowly,
and the contents of his slender purse so rapidly, that
he was compelled to enter an hospital, after discharging
his medical attendant's bill, and finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
himself possessed but of one sovereign, at the end of
another fortnight.</p>

<p>For six dreary months Ned Wilcom's feeble state
compelled him to remain an inmate of this charitable
establishment; and though his wants were amply
provided for, and his complaints and sufferings were
met with prompt and sympathising kindness and
attention, yet his spirit was greatly soured. He ventured
one more letter to his father, but it received no
greater welcome than the former one; and, in the
bitterness of his soul, Ned cursed the parent who
could thus treat his child, and resolved never to write
home again, as long as he lived.</p>

<p>At length, he was strong enough to leave his refuge,
and without staying to be told that he must go, he
went. Once more, he took a cheap lodging, but a much
cheaper one, as far as price went, than before, and in
one of the purlieus of Lambeth, where he would have
scorned almost to set his foot, when he first arrived
in London. Though his scanty sovereign would
have recommended instant search for a situation, his
great weakness, and his looking-glass, told him he
must take, at least, one week's further rest. He took
it, and then commenced inquiry for a situation, not
at the establishment where his misfortunes commenced,
neither at any of the first-rate fashionable
shops. Sourness of spirit kept him at a distance
from the cathedral churchyard; and the somewhat
seedy condition, even of his best suit, debarred his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
admission, he believed, at any of the "tip-top"
houses. So he sought to be engaged in some more
humble establishment; but, alas! his pallid face and
sunken eye, his hollow voice and feeble step, were
against him; and a shake of the head, or a hard
stare, with a decided negative, was the invariable answer
to his applications.</p>

<p>To shorten the melancholy story of his deeper descent
into wretchedness&mdash;at the end of the tenth
week after his departure from the hospital, he was
so far restored to strength as to be able to walk upright,
to speak in his natural tone of firmness, and
would have been competent to have discharged the
duties of a draper's assistant in any shop in the metropolis;
but every article of clothing he had possessed,
except two shirts, two pairs of stockings, and the
outer suit he constantly wore, were all in pawn, and
he was, now, absolutely&mdash;penniless!</p>

<p>It was when the eleventh week began, and the
dreaded Monday morning returned, when his weekly
lodging-rent should be paid, that Ned stealthily
descended from his attic, and passed, unobserved by
his landlady, from the front door, to wander he knew
not whither&mdash;except to avoid shame. By the Marsh
Gate he passed, and through the New Cut, and over
Blackfriars' Bridge, and, losing the remembrance of
where he was, he wandered from street to street, till,
suddenly, in Old Street, he was awoke to the sense of
delight&mdash;a feeling he had long been a stranger to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>&mdash;by
seeing a half-crown at the edge of the pavement,
as he sauntered along with his head dropped
on his chest. He snatched it up with inconceivable
eagerness: no one was near to whom he could suppose
it belonged, had his necessity permitted him to
think of asking for its proper owner; and galled by
a complete abstinence of two whole days, he hurried
to the very first appearance of food that met his
eye&mdash;a stall of coarse shell-fish.</p>

<p>"How d'ye sell them?&mdash;what d'ye call them?"
were the questions he put to the poor ragged man
who stood by this stall of strange vendibles that
Ned had seen poverty-stricken children and females
stand to eat, but had never tasted them himself.</p>

<p>"Ve calls 'em vilks, sir," answered the man,
"six a penny: shall I open ye a penn'orth o' fresh
uns, sir?"</p>

<p>"Oh! these will do&mdash;let me have a dozen," said
Ned Wilcom, and seized, and devoured a couple in a
moment.</p>

<p>"La! stop, sir!" cried the man&mdash;"you vants winegar
to 'em!"&mdash;and he took the old broken bottle
of earthenware, with the cork and a hole in it, and
would fain have poured some of the horrible adulteration
upon the shell-fish, but the very smell of it was
too much for the youth's senses. He devoured the
dozen; but though the first mouthful had seemed
delicious, he had some difficulty in gulping the last;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and had not proceeded twenty paces from the stall,
after receiving the change for his half-crown, before
he felt half overcome with sickness and nausea.
He was about to pass by a dram-shop&mdash;but the
thought suddenly struck him that a small glass of
brandy would dispel the sickness; and he stepped in
and called for one. An elderly female was sipping
a very small glass of liquor, when Ned crossed the
threshold, but passed out immediately, after giving
him a keen glance, as he gave his call, and laid a
shilling on the dram-shop counter. By this woman
he was immediately accosted, when he quitted the
dram-shop:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you taken coffee this morning, sir?" said
she, with a short courtesy: "I shall be happy to accommodate
you, if you have not, sir: my house is
just here, sir"&mdash;and so saying, she led the way into
Bath Street, at the corner of St. Luke's, and Ned,
half-helplessly, followed; for though the brandy had
dispelled the sickness, it seemed to have given a
wolvish strength to his two days' hunger.</p>

<p>A younger female, tawdrily clad, but possessing
features of sufficient power to attract Ned's especial
gaze, was the only apparent occupant of the
low habitation into which the elderly woman led the
way. Breakfast was speedily prepared, in a somewhat
humble mode, but Ned was too hungry to be
delicate. The younger woman was soon engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
so freely and familiarly in conversation with the
youth, as to venture a mirthful observation on his
good appetite. Ned's heart glowed too warmly with
the fitful delight of having found the half-crown and
the means of a breakfast, to permit him to cultivate
secrecy. He told it outright&mdash;the fact that he had
fasted two days, and found the half-crown but half
an hour before on the pavement. What will not the
tongue tell, when the heart has been suddenly and
unexpectedly unbondaged, though it be but temporarily,
from deep-during sorrow?</p>

<p>And then, of course, that confession led to others,
and the whole story of Ned's life and parentage, of
his sickness and harsh treatment, and of his sufferings
and deprivations, till that moment, were unfolded.
And then came the formidable question&mdash;What
did he now intend to do?&mdash;and it was one that
brought back the full sense of his misery, for his
half-crown was reduced already to a shilling; and he
knew not what must become of him when that was
spent&mdash;unless he stood in the streets to beg!</p>

<p>The evil moment that was to seal Ned's ruin was
come. The elderly female at a glance given her by
the younger, which the youth's misery prevented his
observing, threw on her shawl, and went out.&mdash;</p>

<p>She returned&mdash;but it was after two hours had
passed; and Ned Wilcom, who, when he entered
London, believed himself heir to a gentleman's fortune
and rank, had become the slave of a prostitute,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and had pledged himself to take lessons from her in
the practice of dishonesty. That very afternoon, he
entered on his guilty profession: she hung on his
arm, and as they entered a crowded thoroughfare she
taught him to purloin, successively, a handkerchief, a
book, and a watch, from the pockets of passengers.</p>

<p>The perfect security with which his first thefts
were accomplished, and the galling remembrance of
his past indignities, added to the new fascination
above mentioned, stifled the reproaches of Ned Wilcom's
conscience, when the hour of reflection came.
He advanced in the downward path, until he became
a daring burglar, and a skilful adept at swindling,
under the name of card-playing, in addition to his
more petty practice on pockets. Some idea of his
son's fate, at length reached the brutal and sordid
mind of Wilcom the elder. He commissioned a
friend, two or three times, on his London journies, to
make strict inquiry as to the accuracy of the reports
concerning Ned. The youth avoided the search as
much as possible, but could not prevent the truth
from reaching his native town.</p>

<p>The catastrophe approached in another year. The
papers contained an account of Ned's apprehension
for a series of daring robberies: his father's acquaintances
boldly and honestly reprehended his unparental
cruelty; and though the Mammon-worshipping
wretch was unmoved for some time, at length he
dashed up to town to "see what all the noise was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
about," as he said. He arrived soon enough to see
his son at the bar as a degraded criminal; and before
he had gazed upon him for more than five minutes,
heard him sentenced to transportation for life! Ned
was immediately reconducted to his cell, while his
father fell, senseless, in the Court; and though he
was taken home to Leeds the following week, it was
to be a helpless, doting paralytic, and a proverb to
the end of his life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<h2>LONDON 'VENTURE;</h2>

<p class="center">OR,<br />
THE OLD STORY OVER AGAIN.</p>


<p>It was in the year '39, a little before the "Dog-cart
Nuisance," as it used to be called, was abolished in
London, that Ingram Wilson had some curious
thoughts as he stood looking at a very old and
interesting dog, in one of the by-streets of the
Borough.&mdash;Ingram Wilson, it ought to have been
first said, was a young man who had forsaken an
engagement on a thriving newspaper in an opulent
agricultural district, and had "come up to London,"
partly through a slight disagreement with his former
patron, but chiefly through a vivid persuasion, that
London was the only true starting point for "a man
of genius," a title to which young Ingram laid
claim. Now, this claim had never been questioned
by any one in the country, and Ingram thought
every one would as readily acknowledge it in the
metropolis. How could Ingram Wilson help think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>ing
so, when every body had asked him, for three
years, "why he did not go to London, and make
his fortune?" But, good-lack! when Ingram arrived
in London, and had stared at all the lions
for three days, he began to feel himself in a desert,
even amidst thousands. He knew nobody, and
nobody knew him. He stept into two or three
newspaper offices, stationers' shops, and booksellers'
little warehouses, asking questions about an engagement;
but people looked at him so suspiciously,
that he grew afraid of asking further. He looked
at the Times, and the Herald, and the Chronicle
every morning, in one coffee-house or other&mdash;walked
to this place and that&mdash;or wrote letters of
application, in answer to advertisements, but all
was in vain: two months fled entirely, and he had
not received a single hour's employ, or earned one
farthing in London; and he was now reduced to his
last sovereign!</p>

<p>Feeling the necessity of an instant resort to the
strictest and most prudential economy, he quitted
his lodgings, and found one, (a beggarly bed, a
chair, and broken table, in a fifth floor,) at eighteen-pence
a week. All day he was out, and sometimes
dined on threepenn'orth of boiled beef and potatoes,
and sometimes he didn't: however, he contrived
to make the sovereign last one more month, for he
still found no employ. And now he was come to
selling or pawning&mdash;what he had never been driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to before, in his life. His books none of the pawn-brokers
would have: they were an article that
could be turned to no account, if not redeemed. So
Ingram pawned his watch; but for so small a sum,
that though he was still more economical, he could
only stretch another month on the "lent money,"
as he called it, little supposing he would never see
the watch again. And then went extra articles of
clothing, till he could go no farther. And when
six months were gone, part of his books were gone
likewise; but they were <i>sold</i> at comparatively waste-paper
price at the second-hand booksellers.</p>

<p>It was then, at the expiration of six months'
trial of London, without having found one hour's
employ, and when he had reduced his clothes till he
looked "shabby," and had not half-a-dozen books
left that would fetch him the value of another week's
subsistence at the book-stalls;&mdash;it was then that
young Ingram Wilson had "some curious thoughts
as he stood looking at a very old and interesting
dog, in one of the by-streets of the Borough."</p>

<p>Ingram had been much disgusted with every dog-cart
he had seen before; for he was driven to moralise,
almost by necessity, as he wandered about
from street to street; and he had made many a
notch in his mind about costermongers riding on
the front of their dog-carts in a morning, "four-in-hand,"
and all in a row, yelping as they galloped
under the lash of the whip; and how much they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
must resemble Esquimaux emperors and Kamschatka
princes, if there were any; and of the
wicked glee of the rascally young sweeps who
would rattle down Blackfriars' Road, and St. George's
Road, and other roads of an evening, racing one
against another&mdash;"taking home" the one-dog shay
of some cat's meat man or dealer in greens, who
had thus committed his chariot and animals to these
sooty Jehus, while he himself staid at some favourite
resort to smoke and tipple "heavy wet" till midnight.
I say, young Ingram Wilson had made
many a notch in his mind about these, and other
dog-cart phenomena; but he had never felt so much
melancholy interest in looking at a dog in a cart, as
he felt in looking at this "very old and interesting
dog."</p>

<p>There might be something in the way in which
his attention was first aroused to look at the dog.
He had just entered this by-street, and was so
much absorbed in reflecting on his own increasingly
perilous circumstances, that he had not even noticed
the name of the street (though this was a practice
he usually attended to so punctually, that he grew
quite familiar with numerous localities during the
six months):&mdash;he merely saw that it was a street of
some length, with a ground-story room to every
house on the right hand, what would be termed a
cellar in the country,&mdash;fenced off by neat palisades
from the flagged pavement. His reverie was broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
suddenly, by the shrill, and peculiarly disagreeable,
and well-known cry "Cat's m-e-a-t!" and the man
jumped from his vehicle, the dog stood stock still,
and almost along the whole line of the street, cats
white, and black, and tabby, and tortoiseshell, were
suddenly at the palisades, of the houses, setting up
their backs and tails, and uttering a shrill "mew!"
Ingram was a little struck with this; but still more
with a fine large black tom-cat, that leaped from
the palisade of the house where the cart was standing,
and ran under the old dog's head. Setting up
his back and tail, he passed under the head of the
dog again and again, so coaxingly and soothingly,
and uttered so kindly sympathetic a "purr," every
time that he passed backward and forward, and the
poor aged dog arched his neck, and hung his ears
forward, and bent down to receive the soft rub of
the cat's back under his chin, and looked so grateful,
that Ingram stood still, and pondered curiously
on this display of sympathy between brute creatures&mdash;a
quality that he began to think scarce among
human beings.</p>

<p>The poor old dog looked almost like a bag of
leather, with a collection of old bones in it: he was
so gaunt and worn, and the hair was so much chafed
off, in sundry places with his harness; and, moreover,
his back and limbs were so crooked and bent,
that Ingram felt sure the dog had known no slight
portion of slavery in his day. And, perhaps, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
a hard master, and no one sympathised with him but
this black tom-cat, thought the poverty-stricken philosopher&mdash;but
who sympathises with me? That was
his only sour thought, but it did not abide with
him. The man returned to the cart, said, "Go on!"
and the dog went on; but none of the other cats
came to rub under the old dog's head. Ingram felt
he was attracting the man's frowning notice, by
standing to look at the dog, and so he walked on
to think.</p>

<p>"The world is not <i>all</i> misery for that poor old
dog," thought Ingram, as he walked on: "very
likely, the few minutes' pleasure he receives every
morning from the gentle sympathy of the black tom-cat
renders him happily forgetful of the labour and
hardness of the remaining part of the day. And
yet, the poor old dog looked as if he were poorly
fed; and what a mortification it must be to be carrying
food to the cats, and have so little himself: always
in the smell of it, but never or seldom to
taste: almost as bad as Tantalus steeped to the very
chin, and most likely drenched through the skin, and
yet dry as a fish! There is a something that pleases
me, however, very much, in this act of the kind,
brotherly tom-cat," said Ingram to himself, "and
I'll see this sight again."</p>

<p>And Ingram saw the sight again, for he took care
to walk in the same neighbourhood for the three
mornings following, and felt increasing pleasure in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
witnessing the black tom-cat rub his back under the
poor old dog's chin, while the dog looked each morning
as richly gratified as ever. Ingram Wilson was
satisfied that if those few minutes' pleasure did not
form a compensation for the poor dog's every day's
pain, they went very far towards it.</p>

<p>But the circumstance of a pale, handsome young
man, though rather seedily dressed, coming through
that particular street every morning, for four mornings,
at the same hour, and standing to look at that
old dog and tom-cat, was an occurrence not likely
to go unnoticed in London, where people notice
every minute circumstance in a way that much surprised
Ingram Wilson, when he first began to find it
out, for he had calculated on a very different sort of
feeling in that respect. Nothing, indeed, annoyed
him so much as the keen impudent stare of strangers,
full in his face, and for several seconds: for Ingram
did not reflect that he must be staring equally hard,
or he would not know that other people were staring
at him. And nothing pestered him more than to
observe passengers smile and talk to their companions,
as they observed Ingram's lips move, when some
thought passed through his mind earnestly; and yet
he forgot how much he had been struck with that
circumstance, above every thing, when he first walked
along Cheapside, and Ludgate and Fleet Streets, and
the Strand: the very great number of people who
talked to themselves as they walked alone, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
motioned with their hands in the most earnest
manner.</p>

<p>Ingram had been closely observed, and the observance,
on the fourth morning, produced him an
adventure. He was turning to move on, at the end
of his fourth soliloquy on the dog-and-cat spectacle,
when a tall gentlemanly person, with a cane, stepped
from the house where the tom-cat ran in, and seemed
bent on walking along the street in Ingram's company.</p>

<p>"A fine morning, sir," said the gentleman: "you
seemed to be interested with our fine old cat and his
way of saying, 'How d'ye do?' to the old dog, every
morning."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I was," answered Ingram, somewhat
pleased with the pretty expression, as he thought it,
of the gentleman, and the silvery voice in which he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Ay, sir, there's more kindness among dumb
creatures than we think of," rejoined the gentleman:
"much more, I'm inclined to think, than amongst
human beings."</p>

<p>"Do you think so, sir?" asked Ingram; for the
observation awoke a vague painfulness that he did
not like, at once, to express to a stranger.</p>

<p>"Why, have <i>you</i> found nothing but kindness,
young man, in the world, hitherto?" said the stranger,
with a look that Ingram thought so benevolent as
to be completely melted by it. "Have you found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
nothing but kindness, now, in London, permit me to
ask? You are from the country, I think?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Ingram, feeling too much at
work with regret within to say more.</p>

<p>"Seeking for a situation, and finding none, perhaps?"
continued the gentleman; "and&mdash;but I
shall, perhaps, be obtruding where I have no right&mdash;perhaps,
beginning to feel it difficult to subsist?"</p>

<p>Ingram looked volumes, but could not reply: he
had lived on two cups of muddy coffee and a roll,
daily, for the last month, and this was the first
and only human being who had troubled himself
to ask him a question relative to his circumstances.
Ingram was next invited, very, very kindly, to return
to the stranger's house; and he could not muster
pride enough to refuse. There was one face at the
window, which had been there every one of the four
mornings that Ingram had passed, although he had
not seen it; but he saw it now, and he thought it
the sweetest he had ever seen; and, indeed, it was
looking very angelically just then, when he caught
the first glimpse of it. 'Twas an expression that
said, "Oh! he's come back, just as I wished!"&mdash;if
Ingram could have read it.</p>

<p>Ingram Wilson had found a friend: not a rich
one, as he speedily found, but a human being with a
heart&mdash;a <i>real</i> heart&mdash;and Ingram could not have
found any thing more valuable had he searched the
world over. After partaking a good plain breakfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>&mdash;for,
although the forenoon was advanced, the poor
young fellow had not, till then, broken his fast&mdash;Ingram
composed his spirits, and, at the request of
his new friend&mdash;his first London friend&mdash;related
the cause and intent of his leaving the country. His
course of suffering in London he touched upon but
slightly at first; but the gentleman gradually and
winningly drew the entire truth from him, and then
proceeded, with a paternal look, to give Ingram some
little advice as to the future.</p>

<p>"You have only erred as hundreds have erred
before you," he said:&mdash;"hundreds! I might
have said thousands; for it is not merely through
the persuasion that they shall be able to attain
eminence in literature that the young come on
adventure to London. A sort of universal romantic
idea pervades the minds of most young people with
regard to the capital; and, indeed, it is the same
almost all over Europe, and, for any thing I know to
the contrary, all over the world. I am sure, however,
that the feeling is equally strong, and I think
stronger in France. All young French people have
an idea that Paris is the only place wherein to attain
their wishes. With the same impression, all young
people imagine, if they can only struggle up to
London, they shall make something out in the world.
Alas! thousands reach this overgrown hive, merely
to starve and die in it; and they are fortunate who
can find their way back into the country without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
falling victims to their own romance. Now, permit
me to ask&mdash;and yet, your own account of the little
rupture of good feeling between your former patron
and yourself almost answers the question beforehand&mdash;did
you bring with you any note of introduction
or recommendation to any person in London?"</p>

<p>Ingram answered, that the thought had presented
itself before he left the country, that a note of introduction
from his patron to certain newspaper
offices might be serviceable, but pride and temporary
anger had prevented his asking the favour.</p>

<p>Ingram's new friend shook his head, but looked
compassionately upon the lad, and told him nothing
could be done without an introduction in London:
it was what every one looked for who received an
application, and what every body must be furnished
with who made one.</p>

<p>The youth caught eagerly at the information, and
said he could yet obtain a note of introduction&mdash;and
he thought more than one&mdash;from the country:&mdash;such
notes, too, as he thought must certainly be
available in procuring him an engagement on some of
the leading periodicals: or, perhaps, an offer for an
independent work; and he had several tales and
romances begun.</p>

<p>The gentleman smiled, but soon warned Ingram,
in a serious tone, not to depend so sanguinely on
what he had not tried. "I said that nothing could
be done without an introduction," he continued; "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
I did not tell you that introductions were always successful
in bringing benefits to those who presented
them."</p>

<p>However, Ingram's constitution did not permit
him to sober down without experience, when once an
idea had seized him. The gentleman quickly perceived
it; for he had partaken of the same temperament
in youth, although he had cooled down by age and
disappointment. He did not use further dissuasion,
then; but permitted Ingram to retire to his lodgings
to write the letters he began to talk about, with hope
beaming so lucidly in his face, and only pressed him
cordially to sup with him in the evening. Ingram
retired, shaking hands fervently and gratefully with
the gentleman and his elderly lady, and then with
the daughter&mdash;and saw nothing, mentally, all the
way to his lodgings, but the sweet face of her whose
hand he had last shaken. A thousand visions succeeded
during that day as he wrote the letters&mdash;thought
again and again of the beautiful face&mdash;took
the letters to the post-office&mdash;and, in the evening,
again saw the sweet face, and talked with the sensible
gentleman, and received his kind hospitality.</p>

<p>The gentleman ventured to give a hint that he
himself had influence enough to help Ingram to some
occasional employs a copyist at the British Museum;
but Ingram had, all along, most romantically
resolved to aim at something more dignified; and, in
his present sanguine mood, in spite of his poverty, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
gave no ear to the gentleman's hint. So the gentleman
did not repeat his hint; but reserved it, for
an occasion when, he feared, it would become but too
acceptable to the young man.</p>

<p>A week passed, and Ingram breakfasted at ten,
and supped at eight, every morning and evening of
the term, with the gentleman and his wife and
daughter. The week was one of immense anxiety
to Ingram when he was at his own lodgings, or wandering
in the street; but it was productive of real
pleasure, in the shape of solid information and advice
from the kind gentleman; and it gave a commencement
to a mutual and avowed attachment between
the youth and the gentleman's beautiful and gentle
daughter.</p>

<p>At the end of a week, two letters of introduction
arrived: one to the M.P. who represented the
borough in which Ingram had resided, and to whose
cause he had rendered some service in his former
newspaper capacity; the other was from a baronet,
Ingram had also served in a similar mode, to a literary
man of some eminence; in fact, the M.P. was also
an eminent <i>littérateur</i>, so that Ingram's hopes grew
large and fervid. The gentleman advised moderation;
but Ingram <i>could</i> not observe it: his constitution,
as yet, was master of his reason. He was
smilingly received by the literary man; but he could
not help observing that the literary man smiled more
as he read the baronet's letter, than at his, Ingram's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
application. He was begged politely to call again.
He <i>did</i> call again&mdash;and again&mdash;-and again&mdash;before
he found the literary man once more "at home."
The event was a recommendation to wait on a small
publisher, who had commenced a small periodical, and
wanted a young man of genius, and all that, to edit
it. Ingram went to work in that quarter:&mdash;helped
to bring out four weekly numbers of the periodical&mdash;received
one sovereign for his month's labour&mdash;and
then the thing was stopped, like hundreds of
similar ephemera, because "it did not sell."</p>

<p>The same literary man was visited again, when
this engagement failed; but Ingram left his door in
wrath, and never called again; because <i>he saw</i> the
literary man enter his own house, while he, Ingram,
was but at a dozen yards' distance from it; and yet
the servant affirmed "he was not at home."</p>

<p>Ingram's better and more magnificent hopes,
however, were yet undissipated. During his month's
harassing and ill-paid labour on the unsuccessful
magazine, he was awaiting an important decision:
at least he believed so. The literary M.P. had also
received him with smiles&mdash;smiles that Ingram had
been inured to at election seasons; but which, as
green as he was, he always <i>felt</i> to be assumed;
for it is the heart, not the understanding, that really
judges of the genuineness of a smile. Yet, on the
occasion of Ingram's first call at the town residence
of the legislator, the smile was so prolonged, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Ingram conceived it to be more like a <i>real</i> smile,
than the evanescent and valvular-like changes of skin
and muscle that the M.P. always seemed to have at
such delightful and momentary command while
"canvassing" or "returning thanks," in the borough
he represented. And then the M.P. entered, of his
own accord, on the inquiry as to <i>what</i> Ingram had
written, and begged he would entrust a little manuscript
or two, to his, the M.P.'s, care, and <i>he</i> would
place them in the hand of <i>his own</i> publisher, with <i>his
own</i> recommendation, <i>if</i> he believed they possessed
merit.</p>

<p>The <i>if</i> shook Ingram a little; but he, next day,
took his best manuscript, and left it at the M.P.'s
house, for <i>he</i> was "<i>not</i> at home," like the other literary
man, although Ingram really thought he heard
his voice, when the servant took in the name of the
caller; but the valet said, "Not at home, sir," when
he returned, and so Ingram left the manuscript, and
called again next day. To make the story as short
as possible, he called fifteen times during the four
weeks, but had only one more interview with the
literary M.P. during that term; and this was the
product of it: the M.P. assured Ingram that his
manuscript possessed merit, much merit; that he
had left it with his own publisher; and begged
Ingram would call again in a few more days, and
he would tell him whether the publisher received it.</p>

<p>This seemed to Ingram Wilson a very solid foun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>dation
for most magnificent hopes. How could a
publisher refuse a manuscript which was so highly
recommended? and how could the M.P. fail, very
highly, to recommend what he himself said "possessed
merit, much merit?" Such were Ingram's
questions; and he was a little shocked to see his
friend, the kind gentleman, shake his head and give
a silent look, when they were proposed in the gentleman's
hearing.</p>

<p>Another month passed, and the dream was dissipated!
Ingram was always answered, "Not at
home," when he called at the M.P.'s: his friend,
the kind gentleman, called at the publisher's, and
learned, most unequivocally, that the publisher had
never had such a manuscript presented to him, either
by the M.P. or any other person: Ingram wrote to
the M.P., and received his manuscript by a messenger,
for an answer; and was only prevented from
writing back to tell the M.P. he was a rascal, by the
advice, or, rather, <i>authority</i>, for it amounted to that,
of his friend, the kind gentleman.</p>

<p>And now, Ingram, spirit-broken and humbled with
what he conceived to be his sanguine and foundationless
folly, vowed to his friend that he would never
believe promises in future, and would copy at the
Museum, or "do any thing" as a means of obtaining
a mere livelihood, till he could finish one of his
works entirely, and try a publisher by his own application,
and solely on the merits of his production.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
The gentleman cheered the youth, as well as he was
able, but Ingram drooped from that time.</p>

<p>A winter of heartache, inward grief, mortified
pride, colds and coughs, and, eventually, consumption,
succeeded. And then the sweet face of his
beloved faded; and when the spring returned, it did
not bring back the roses to her cheek.</p>

<p>A summer of toil for little pecuniary reward succeeded
that winter, and Ingram received, at length,
the appalling information from his friend, the kind
gentleman, that he had embarrassed himself by entertaining
him, for the gentleman was merely a
retired half-pay naval officer. A look, depicturing
such agony as Ingram never saw before, in the face
of man, accompanied this declaration on the part of
his friend, and Ingram never felt so truly miserable,
since he was born, as he felt while witnessing it.</p>

<p>There was no room for hesitation: Ingram never
tasted food in the kind gentleman's house after that
avowal. Yet he called every day to exchange words
of grateful friendship with the gentleman, words and
looks of love with the beautiful being that was fast
journeying to the tomb. In mid-winter she died:
her delicate constitution, her sensitive fears and
griefs for Ingram's fate, combined, were too much
for her endurance.</p>

<p>Ingram drooped, and became a dependent on charity,
in an hospital for six weeks; and then the kind
gentleman and his wife followed his corpse to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
grave, which was dug beside that of their daughter&mdash;the
beloved of the unfortunate young man of genius!</p>

<p>Will the story prevent or check romance and adventure
in others? Ah! no: more Chattertons will
perish, more Otways be choked with a crust, unless
human nature becomes unlike its former and present
self; ay, and more Shakespeares will prosper, in the
ages to come, or, otherwise, the true glory and vigour
of the human mind have all gone by, and the future
must feed on its dregs!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE LAD WHO FELT LIKE A FISH
OUT OF WATER.</h2>


<p>Diggory Lawson was not fond of his baptismal
name, and often wondered what in the world had put
it into his father's head to give him such a one. But
where was the use of grumbling, now the name was
inevitably his own?&mdash;was a sensible thought which
often passed through the brain of Dig (for his mother
used to shorten the awkward name into that still
more awkward one of three letters), where was the
use of grumbling about it? His name could not
mend him if Nature had marred him, nor could it
mar him if Nature had made him fit for any good
and useful purpose of existence.</p>

<p>With such thoughts, though but a very little
lad, Diggory used to ramble, when school was up,
about pleasant Nottingham, where he was born, and
about its charming neighbourhood. His father was
only a poor lace-weaver; but an affectionate and
almost overweening fondness for their only child
rendered his parents prompt to sacrifice any personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
comfort, in order to secure him a respectable portion
of education. The lad was, therefore, kept steadily
at school. But his father mingled no little of the
eccentric in his constitution, as may be guessed from
the name he gave his child, for he had no "family
reason" for it; and so it happened, which was not
at all the worse, that the lad was not left to gather
his knowledge simply from the dry and barren teaching
of a day-school. His father was a dabbler in the
mathematics, in astronomy, in dialling, in botany
and floriculture, in history and antiquities; and so
Dig Lawson caught a tincture of each of these knowledges,
at such seasons as his father felt disposed to
communicate what he knew of them.</p>

<p>Nor did the irregularity of communication in his
father's fragmentary hints prevent the lad's mind
and its stores from taking a regular form. That
form was somewhat unique, perhaps, but a true
philosopher would have thought it symmetrical. The
lad did not forget his humble condition: he was
never proud: but his thinkings were far more exalted
than those of the majority of the children who were,
at times, his playmates. The greater part of his
leisure was spent in lonely wanderings. And if any
locality in England can tend to elevate the sentiments
of its young habitants, one would think it to
be Nottingham. Such was its effect, however, on
the mind of young Dig Lawson: he became a vehicle
of noble, though somewhat romantic thinkings, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
wandering in the meadows by the beautiful Trent,
and watching, alternately, the ripple of the stream,
or the unfolding of some beautiful flower that grew
on its border; or rambling over the wildernesses of
the Forest-ground, so classically English, and giving
himself up, for the nonce, to day-dreams of Robin
Hood, till he half imagined he saw the merry band
tripping over the hill-side among the furze and
stunted trees, clad in their Lincoln green, and heard
the real sound of bold Robin's bugle; or climbing
the rocks that project round the beautiful park, and
looking up at "Mortimer's Hole" in the castled cliff,
and picturing the chivalrous attack on the concealed
traitor by the mailed bands of the third Edward; or
creeping among the strange-looking Druid caves on
the border of the silver Lene, and conjuring up in his
imagination the white-bearded priests crowned with
oak, and bearing the "mistletoe bough," and chanting
the hymn to the sun or moon, while a crowd of
painted Britons struck up the chorus "Derry-down."
Less florid but more substantial thinkings often occupied
him, when he watched the last rays of the
setting sun tint up the windows of the modern building
called "the Castle" (the unruly Radicals had
not blackened it then,) and remembered how, on its
memorable rock, the fated Stuart first unfurled the
standard of war against his own people and parliament,
and how unweariedly the high-souled and incorruptible
Hutchinson sustained the harassments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
petty faction so long on the same spot. These more
weighty thoughts, especially, visited him as his boyhood
began to ripen into youth. And as soon as his
understanding began to mature, and he became
capable of combining the useful with the comely, in
his delights and preferences, he could derive almost
as much pleasure from a walk round the splendid
area of the market-place of his native town, as from
a stroll in the park, or by the Trent. He was often
told there was no market-place like it in England;
and he felt as proud of its superb space and neat
ornamental piazzas, as if he were a man, and owner of
half the buildings round it. Diggory Lawson, therefore,
had not yet become "the lad who felt like a
fish out of water."</p>

<p>Neither did Dig at all resemble such an unfortunate
animal for the three years, that is to say, from
fourteen to seventeen, that he passed at his father's
humble trade. Every leisure season was spent in
literature; and he had not only read some hundreds
of volumes by the time that he had reached the age
of seventeen, but he had made some attempts at original
composition that were by no means contemptible.
The lad was happy enough, and was likely to
make a happy and useful man, had "Luck"&mdash;that
spirit with so questionable a name&mdash;kept out of his
father's way, and thereby prevented the father from
placing himself in Dig's way.</p>

<p>The brilliant but evanescent "Bobbin-net" specu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>lation
sprung up, like a forest of mushrooms&mdash;with
an immense surface of promise, but very slender
stalk for continuance&mdash;in the town of Nottingham.
Diggory's father was just the man to jump into a
new scheme; and he really jumped into the bobbin-net
speculation to some purpose, apparently, for he
realised a thousand pounds' profit in twelve months.
Such "luck," of course, determined him to continue
in the pursuit of money, in the same line; but he
was seized, alas! with a vehement resolution to make
Dig into a gentleman!</p>

<p>The large admixture of whimsicality in his father's
composition, however, left Diggory's destiny in a
very nondescript condition for some time; since his
ideas of the exactest, best, and fittest way of making
his lad into the thing he thought of were none of the
clearest, and most fixed. One step, and one only,
could Dig's father determine upon&mdash;and that was&mdash;that
Dig should work no more! No: he could work
himself, and could make as much money as ever Dig
would want as long as he lived: but Dig shouldn't
work; and his mother said, "No, <i>that</i> he shouldn't,"
when she heard her husband say so; and so Dig was
compelled, as the neighbours said, to "drop it"&mdash;and
to lay aside his every-day clothes, and put on his
Sunday ones, and to consider that, from that day
forth, he had done working with his hands&mdash;to the
end of his life.</p>

<p>Well: for a lad of seventeen, who was so fond of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
books and of sentimentalising by the Trent, and in
the Park, and as far as Clifton Grove, this was, certainly,
for the first week, a glorious state of existence.
But, somehow or other, the second holyday week, in
Sunday clothes every day, was not so happy as the
first; and when the third arrived&mdash;then Diggory
Lawson, for the first time in his life, became "the
lad who felt like a fish out of water." The river did
not look so beautiful and silvery, nor the flowers so
lovely, nor the Park so green; in brief, Dig was tired
of all he saw, and all he read, and tired even of himself;
and he told his father and mother so outright.
But la! the mother had an answer for Dig so nicely
opportune that she was in ecstacies to tell it&mdash;for
she was sure it was a piece of such excellent "luck."
Mrs. Strutabout, the lace-merchant's lady (who had
a large family of unmarried daughters), had sent so
politely to say that she would be very happy to see
<i>young</i> Mister Lawson to tea that afternoon&mdash;and
they were such respectable people! Dig's father
said, "Capital! just the thing!" when he heard it;
for he felt instantaneously sure&mdash;and indeed all his
convictions ran by fits and starts&mdash;that <i>that</i> was certainly
a step towards making Dig into a gentleman.
An introduction to genteel society, to "respectable"
company&mdash;what could be finer?</p>

<p>Diggory himself, however, hung his head, and felt
shy about it, for he had never been "out to tea" before,
in his life. But his father said, "Pshaw! you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
young shame-face! you must shake all that off: remember
I intend you to be as respectable a man as
any of 'em!" And the mother reminded Diggory
that he would be sure to hear some music, for the
young ladies Strutabout were thumping away on the
piano from morning to night; you might hear them
any hour of the day that you went by the front-room
windows. It was the last hint that enabled
Diggory to master his bashfulness; for although he
knew not a note scientifically, nor could he play on
any instrument, yet his love of music amounted to a
passion.</p>

<p>And so, at five o'clock in the afternoon, Dig
knocked, with a heart pit-a-pat, at the front-door of
the merchant Strutabout, and was immediately welcomed
in, and received, in the best room, by Mrs.
Strutabout herself, so smilingly&mdash;and by the half
dozen Misses Strutabout, so sweetly&mdash;that he hardly
knew where he was with the novelty of so much
genteel welcome. One of the young ladies, so gently
and winningly, took his hat, saying, "Pray let me
take your hat, <i>Mister</i> Lawson!"&mdash;for poor Diggory,
in his plainness, had brought it into the room, and,
for the life of him did not know where to put it!
And then "the infinite deal of nothings" that the
young ladies talked for a full half hour&mdash;Mrs. Strutabout
herself retiring, and saying so politely, "She
hoped Mister Lawson would excuse her a short
time,"&mdash;and poor Diggory's difficulty in framing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
answers about nothing! If they had talked of anybody
he knew from books, either of Socrates or
Alexander, of Cicero or Cæsar, of Wat Tyler or
John of Gaunt, of Hampden or Lord Chatham, of
Marlborough or Napoleon; or of anybody that was
"worth talking about," as he said to himself; or of
any thing, or place, or substance, of which any thing
could be said that was sensible, Diggory could have
talked, ay, and in good, thundering, long-syllabled
words, too, as well as any man or youth in the three
kingdoms. But to take up a full half-hour in prattling
about&mdash;Lord! he could not describe it when he
returned home, it was such infantile sort of stuff as
he had never supposed mortals uttered in "respectable"
or any other sort of society! Diggory Lawson
was, indeed, during that half-hour, "the lad that felt
like a fish out of water."</p>

<p>At length, Mrs. Strutabout sailed in with her high
turban cap, and her wide-spread swelling dress, more
smilingly than ever, and the tea was brought in, and
Mr. Strutabout arrived from the counting-house, and
places began to be taken, and <i>Mister</i> Lawson was
"begged" to come to the table, "unless he chose to
take a cup where he was." Diggory stared at the
addition to the invitation. And it was well for him
that Mr. Strutabout jumped up, and began to urge
him to the table, for had they handed Dig a cup of
tea with cake, as he sat in the recess by the window,
he would have been in a woeful pucker, no doubt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
As it was, he was in trouble enough. Poor Diggory!
he took his tea every day in a basin at home,
and held up a book before it, devouring the contents
of the volume far more eagerly than his food; and it
was a cruel piece of ambition in his mother and father
to thrust him upon "respectable" society so unthinkingly.
It may seem strange to fine drawing-room
people, but with all Dig's knowledge, and as old as
he was, the silver tea-spoon bothered him so indescribably,
in the cup, that he knew not what to do;
yet he durst not put it out upon the tray, because he
saw, by peeping aside with his head down, that no one
else did so. The eldest Miss Strutabout saw this,
and would have liked to show him how to place the
spoon neatly under the side of his forefinger, but
then, it would be so strange a thing to tell him at
table. As for the younger misses they were much
disposed to giggle at poor Dig's awkwardness, only
the mother looked gentle daggers at them, and restrained
their lightness. The good lady strove to
hide Diggory's blunders, and the merchant engaged
the youth in general talk on trade and business, so
as to enable him to get through with the appearance
that he was too much taken up with the conversation
to attend to table etiquette. But for all this good
service and kindly interference, Diggory Lawson,
while at Mrs. Strutabout's tea-table, was indeed,
and of a truth, "the lad who felt like a fish out of
water."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The mortal agony was at last ended; and Diggory
began to hope that he would reap some little enjoyment
from his stay the remainder of the evening,
since the piano was mentioned. But, lackadaisy!
the young ladies thumped and rattled, till Dig
thought it was any thing but music; and as for their
singing&mdash;so unlike the simple ditties of the milkmaids,
under the cows, which he used to listen in
the early summer mornings by the "pasture Trent,"
with the skylark carolling overhead&mdash;so much like
the midnight melody of some stray grimalkin was
the singing of the Misses Strutabout, that it made
Dig wish himself, over and over again, five miles out
of hearing of it. He must endure it, however, since
he dare not offend the family by suddenly withdrawing,
they were so "respectable:" nay, more,
he was compelled to praise, for at the end of every
overture, or solo, or duet, he was asked "how he
liked that?" or "what he thought of that?" and the
poor lad was compelled to torture his tongue into the
utterance of commendations on what he began actually
to loathe, until the announcement of supper gave
a momentary suspension to his discontent. And
merely momentary was his ease, for the confounded
ceremoniousness of the supper plagued him worse than
the etiquette of the tea-table; and passing over the
mention of all his blushes and throbbings, under the
consciousness that he knew nothing about the niceties
of this second eating process, let us come at once to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the end of the adventure, and say that when he had
fairly stepped into the street at ten o'clock, and
when, after unnumbered polite adieus, the door of
the merchant Strutabout was closed behind him,
Diggory Lawson drew in a full breath of air with a
feeling of thankfulness similar to that of one who
passes out of a prison after a twelvemonth's confinement.</p>

<p>Very gleefully did Dig's mother salute her boy
when he came home, and his father not less proudly;
but how queer they felt, when the poor lad told them
he had "felt like a fish out of water!" And when
Diggory had given them such a brief account of his
treat, as his dislike would permit, they looked at
each other, and began to think, and to remember, that
"they ought to have known that the lad would
meet with fine manners that he was unused to at
home." But Dig's father told him to "cheer up,"
for he would know better how to go on another
time. But Diggory, inwardly, felt indisposed to
try another time; yet he did not say so, and so the
affair passed over.</p>

<p>Now Diggory's mother knew no more about the
right way of making the lad into a gentleman than
the father; but she began to grow greatly distressed
at observing the lad's restlessness and disquietude,
for the hours and days went over Diggory's head
more heavily the longer he was idle. So she seriously
took her husband to task, as they say in Notting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>hamshire,
about his delay in determining how Dig
was to begin to be a gentleman. Her discourse
would have rendered the poor man very uneasy,
indeed, had not "luck" extricated him from his
dilemma on the next day succeeding the curtain
lecture.</p>

<p>In his new manufacture, Diggory Lawson's father
did business with a Londoner: this personage made
his quarterly call at the very moment when his
customer was so much intent on the great problem
as to display much concern in his face. A shrewd
question was put: Dig's father told his trouble,
and the cockney gave most instantaneous advice how
the thing was to be done, as soon as he had been
informed of what was so much desired. "The
young man must be had out to travel," he said;
"<i>he</i> would procure him a 'highly respectable'
situation as a genteel commercial traveller for a house
in town: <i>that</i> was the way to set him off in the
world, and make a real gentleman of him, for he
would be thrown into the very best society!"</p>

<p>Such was the cockney's advice; and it was sincere,
too, for the pert little man really believed there was
nothing in the world more "highly respectable" than
that morsel of vanity&mdash;himself! And then his
prate was so fluent, so glib, so high sounding, he
was such a walking vocabulary of commercial phrases,
that he completely enfevered Dig's father with the
persuasion of his cleverness; and the countryman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
yielded to the advice of the Londoner, believing
he had been shown the very best way in the world
for beginning to make his son into a gentleman.
The lad was, it is true, willing to go, he was so weary
of the insipidity of his present idleness, and besides,
he wanted to see London, and other parts of the
country, never having yet quitted his native shire;
but yet his common sense was a little suspicious, that
this was <i>not</i> exactly the way to make him a gentleman.
Still this suspicion on the part of Diggory
was no impediment in the way of a trial&mdash;for the
lad did not so much wish to be a gentleman as a
man&mdash;and he thought a little knowledge of the
world would not prevent his progress towards that
better climax.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lawson, the bobbin-net manufacturer," would
have had his son fashionably clothed ere he started
for town; but the cockney turned up his nose at
the very idea. "It was a thing quite out of character,"
he told Mr. Lawson: "all the country
tailors' fits were reckoned only dresses for scarecrows
by the best tailors in town: it wouldn't do at all: he
was against it, most decidedly!"</p>

<p>Young Diggory, therefore, was impursed with a
handsome sum, more than sufficient to purchase an
outfit in London; for his father well knew he could
trust to his prudence, and was despatched, per mail,
to town, in company with the all-sufficient Londoner.
A week, or so, was spent, in visiting the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
public exhibitions, and seeing the sights,&mdash;a change
of neat suits was purchased (for the lad was too
sensible to be fooled into the kickshaw dandy habits
which the cockney recommended),&mdash;a situation, a
"highly respectable" situation, (although but at very
low remuneration, a thing of no consequence to Diggory,)
was procured by the all-sufficient gentleman;
and off started the new adventurer into Kent, to
canvass for orders for a citizen and dry-salter of
London.</p>

<p>The merchant, his employer, had had but one interview
with him, having engaged him chiefly through
a quick impression of his solid intelligence, rather
than from the cockney's florid recommendation; but
the cockney gave him a regular "drill," as it might
be called in his new profession, before he started
out; and, although the tradesmen upon whom he
called perceived that he was a "new beginner,"
yet his good sense prevented his experiencing any
insurmountable difficulty in making his way as a
commercial traveller. In fact, Diggory had a much
larger stock of theoretical knowledge to enable him
to eke out his deficiencies in what was practical, than
most young fellows who go out, for the first time,
on similar engagements; and, therefore, it was not
as a "greenhorn" among tradesmen, that he was
likely to feel "like a fish out of water:" that was
not the sort of uneasiness that newly awaited Diggory
Lawson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>What was it then?&mdash;Nothing less than the old
pest in a new form:&mdash;etiquette. He had been most
cogently admonished by the cockney to take up his
quarters at the very best commercial inns in his
prescribed route,&mdash;or it would let down his employer,
disgust customers, and injure his patron's business;
nor had he been less earnestly warned to avoid
deporting himself in any way contrary to the rules
and customs of gentlemen he would meet with, who
were "on the road" like himself, and who had
their "highly respectable" established usages. Diggory,
like an obedient son, followed his father's
monitions, and strove to conduct himself exactly as
the Londoner advised and directed. At the first-rate
commercial inn in each town he stopped, hasted
to canvass the tradesmen, and punctually returned
to the inn at the hour when he was told dinner
would be on the table in the "Commercial Room."
Diggory, too, being a sharp lad, as the reader knows
by this time, bought a book on "Etiquette" and
all that sort of thing, while in London: but though
he imagined he would be a match for his new compeers
"of the road," he found himself sorely mistaken,
in the very outset, at Maidstone.</p>

<p>At four, exactly, returned Diggory to his inn,
having despatched considerable business for a mere
beginner, and entered the "Commercial Room." A
buzz and a general whisper went round, as he entered,
and no one returned his courteous movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
(for he followed his book) when he performed it!
The company was large, well-dressed, and from the
"bang-up" appearance of the numerous leather
portmanteaus under the side-tables in the room, and
the dashing whips and proud cloaks on the hooks,
Diggory was sure they were, indeed, what the
cockney would call "highly respectable" commercial
gentlemen, or "gentlemen on the road." It
was strange, he thought, that they should be so
uncourteous. Yet, Diggory observed, that every
new comer was received in the same way; and so he
set it down in his memory that it was the wrong time
of the day for bows of courtesy among "commercial
gentlemen;"&mdash;and that was not a bad idea, either, for
so green an observer,&mdash;especially as the gentlemen
had not dined.</p>

<p>Dinner was brought in, and a tolerably sumptuous
affair it was. "Commercial gentlemen," even at the
"first-rate commercial inns," don't "cut it quite so fat"
(for so vulgar a phrase may be allowed since it will
apply to the dinners) now-a-days, as they did then,&mdash;since
we are speaking of something more than twenty
years bygone; and the last twenty years, with their
wonderful innovations of railway travelling and increased
competition, have made woeful alterations
among your princely commercial travellers: they were
the innkeeper's grandees then: the case is altered
now. Diggory, with all his intellectuality and sentimentalism
and so forth, was pleased to see the goodly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
provisions of the table, for he was very hungry; and
he began to muster up his recollections of "the book
of etiquette."</p>

<p>But, behold!&mdash;a single moment threw all his calculations
out of order. He was the youngest in the
room; and by the rules of the road, he must, therefore,
take the post of vice-president at the dinner!
Diggory's book said nothing about this; for it was
not written expressly for "commercial gentlemen,"
but for "good society" generally. Poor Dig took
the post, however, but felt in a strange perturbation
as the gentleman at his right hand intimated a wish
for a little mutton, and looked at him, "the Vice!"
The chairman was already helping his end of the
table to slices of a sirloin, and so Diggory drew the
piece of hot mutton near him, and was beginning to
cut, but did it so awkwardly that the gentleman at
his right-hand, who was somewhat of a gourmand,
cried out, "Oh dear, sir! not that way!" Diggory
stopped,&mdash;stared,&mdash;blushed: but the chairman, an
elderly and fatherly-looking man, put on an encouraging
smile, and said, "Lengthwise, sir, if you
please; not across: the other way keeps in the
gravy best." Diggory's heart cleaved to the man
who told him this so kindly and handsomely, and he
thanked the chairman, adding, in his simplicity,
that he was unused to carving mutton, especially a
shoulder, he added, looking at it, and thinking it
could not be a leg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"A shoulder!" exclaimed the gentleman on his
right hand, staring like one who was horror-struck;
"why, God bless me, 'tis a saddle!"</p>

<p>Diggory blushed worse than before, for there was
a perceptible laugh round the table; but he made no
reply, and tried to proceed with his work of carving.
Trembling as he did, there was no wonder that he
spattered the right-hand gentleman with gravy until
the gentleman grew angry. And then Diggory
apologised; but the gentleman, still more indignantly,
besought him to go on, and not keep the company
waiting,&mdash;meaning himself. How glad was the lad
when he had succeeded in filling the man's plate, and
silencing him! The rest whom he had to accommodate
were of less irritable natures; but no one
offered to relieve him, until each had despatched their
first plate, and <i>then</i> Diggory's appetite was gone, for
he had not been able to eat a mouthful up to that
time, through the throng of his new and difficult employment.</p>

<p>The next course increased poor Diggory's trouble:
he knew no more about carving a fowl than conducting
a ship to China; and when he had cut off a
blundering slice at a venture, and put it on the right-hand
gentleman's plate, the irritable gourmand stared
ferociously in his face, shovelled the clumsy slice off
the plate into the dish, cried aloud, "Mangling done
here!" and to Diggory's consternation seized the
carving-knife and fork, to cut for himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>And now the chairman interfered. "He trusted
he should be supported by the company, sitting there
as he did: if the young gentleman was an improficient
in the duties of the table, perhaps he might be
allowed to say that they all knew what it was to be
young at one time in their lives, and he <i>did</i> think&mdash;though
he was the last man in the world to wish to
give the slightest offence&mdash;that the gentleman to the
right of the vice-president of that table had not acted
so courteously as he might have done." And then
there was a pretty general "Hear, hear!" But
quickly uprose the irritable gentleman, and rejected
the admonition of the president with scorn, and
thumped the table during his delivery of a most
energetic oration of half a minute, until he shook
the glasses so that they rang changes against each
other.</p>

<p>The irritable gentleman no sooner sat down than
another arose, and another, and another, each demanding
that he should apologise to the president
for his want of courtesy, and the irritable gentleman
yielded to apologise&mdash;though it was far more from
eagerness to eat, than a return of good-nature.&mdash;Diggory
was "assisted" in cutting up the fowl by
one on his left, who began to be warmed with sympathy
for the youth, now the sympathiser's stomach
was allayed in some small degree by sundry hearty
slices of mutton. To the drawing of the cloth
Diggory experienced no further mortification: but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the past was enough, in any conscience; and during
the season in which that company of "highly respectable
gentlemen" were masticating their viands,
poor Diggory, who did not eat three mouthfuls,
might most aptly be styled "the lad who felt like a
fish out of water."</p>

<p>And now the wine was pushed about; and whether
it was the little "tiff" which had taken place during
the dinner, or whatever might be the cause, considerable
difficulty was felt, for some time, by all the
company, in attaining that sense of freedom, that
warm hilariousness, which an Englishman always
looks for, over the bottle, and by the charm of which,
and not by the animal gust for the liquor, drinking
usages have become so widely established. This uneasy
feeling, however, was dissipated by degrees;
and then, by the natural reaction of the human spirits,
the zest for good-fellowship grew unbounded. And
yet this over-heated, steamy sort of boon companionship
manifested itself exactly as might be expected
among "highly respectable commercial gentlemen,"
though poor Diggory was too ignorant of the genus
to make the proper calculation. They neither called
each other by familiar names, nor sang, nor shouted,
nor huzzaed, nor laughed, till they hiccupped.
Compliments, that out-heroded Herod in their gorgeousness
of dress and brilliancy of colouring,&mdash;good-wishes,&mdash;mighty,
vast, profound, coming from
the "bottom of their hearts,"&mdash;for the prosperity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
each other in their undertakings,&mdash;testimonies to
each other's "respectability" (<i>always</i> first), honour,
candour, probity, (take the first catalogue of the
virtues you find, and supply all the rest,)&mdash;flowed
out of the smiling, bubbling, fountain of their wine-warmed
hearts, and wreathed itself so fantastically
into the vaporous shapes of words (if that be nonsense,
take it for a specimen of their speeches),&mdash;that
Diggory Lawson was puzzled to determine
whether they were more lunatic or tipsy.</p>

<p>Luckily, he found a little relief, both corporeally
and mentally in nibbling at the remnant of the dessert,
which the whole company forgot for wine and
speechifying. Yet he had but a torturous time of
it, and was still "the lad who felt like a fish out of
water."</p>

<p>It should scarcely be omitted, that by the natural
way of ascending from the mediocre to the sublime,
so genial to the minds of "highly respectable commercial
gentlemen," the last hour of the speechifying
was entirely occupied by that grand problem,&mdash;that
question of questions,&mdash;that important and absorbing
interrogation of "<i>the</i> commercial room,"&mdash;"Is
it not time to smoke?"</p>

<p>Now the president insisted, that eight o'clock being
the established hour for "permitting to smoke" in
<i>that</i> room, he, as president of <i>that</i> company, sitting
there as he did, could not grant permission to smoke,
since it was but just seven. And then arose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
irritable little gentleman who talked so politely about
"mangling" when Diggory spoilt the fowl. He
really felt that he <i>must</i> claim the indulgence of the
company: but he would appeal to every gentleman
in the room, and he, most conscientiously, felt that
he <i>could</i> safely and confidently appeal to them, and
he was sure they would bear testimony that no one
was more observant than himself of the rules of <i>that</i>
room, (and then there was a general "Hear, hear!"
though Diggory, in spite of his timidity, could not forbear
saying "Hem!")&mdash;and he would feel it beneath
him to infringe on the necessary regulations for the
preservation of comfort in good society; but yet,&mdash;but
yet, on the present occasion,&mdash;feeling as they
all did, that warmth of esteem, and union of sentiment
and feeling, and&mdash;(we omit a page here)&mdash;he
thought the president of that company might take it
upon him to dispense with the peculiar rule relative
to smoking on <i>that</i> occasion.</p>

<p><i>Pro</i> and <i>con</i>&mdash;the arguments were equally laborious,
equally long, and equally senseless; and the
president, being one of the oldest "gentlemen on the
road," and though very bland in his nature, yet a
stickler for custom, stuck to his point to the last,
and was only worsted by the clock. Truly, Diggory
Lawson, during the smoke discussion, was "the lad
who felt like a fish out of water." Much more did
he resemble the said unlucky fish when the smoking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
began, insomuch that he was compelled to seize an
early opportunity of retiring to bed.</p>

<p>Diggory Lawson completed his journey, but returned
to London with a complete mental nausea of
the cockney's plan for making him into a gentleman.
Torn entirely from his beloved books, he was infinitely
more miserable than when their only companionship
subjected him to weariness. His mind
hurried with anxiety, dissipated by the unintellectual
nature of his engagement, annoyed and disgusted
with the manners of those he was compelled to
regard as the proper associates of his leisure, he
wrote home to his father entreating permission to
return. One paragraph will show the character of
his letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not a single thought or habit of my short life
has prepared me for such an engagement as that procured
me by your friend. It was misery enough to
listen to the prattle of 'unidea'd girls,' as Dr. Johnson
expressed himself on a similar occasion; but of
all the tortures in the world, deliver me from the
company of empty, conceit-blown mortals, who have
such large notions of their own importance as these
'highly respectable commercial gentlemen.' I entreat
your permission to return home, for I am 'like a fish
out of water.'"</p>

<p>The boon was readily granted,&mdash;for Diggory's
mother, having never been separated from her child
before, had wept every day since she parted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
him. The very next month, Dig's father gave up
the notion of making him into a gentleman,&mdash;for
the bobbin-net speculation waned,&mdash;and there was
an end to making an immense fortune in a twinkling.
He embarked the little capital he had gained
in the more staple manufacture of the town, took
Diggory into the trade, and associating with plain,
sensible men, and cultivating knowledge in his leisure
hours, Diggory Lawson was happier every day, and
was no longer "the lad who felt like a fish out of
water."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE INTELLECTUAL LEVER THAT
LACKED A FULCRUM.</h2>


<p>Mr. Mortimer had suddenly inherited an estate of
something more than five hundred a year, by the
death of an uncle, and was persuaded by his Whig
acquaintances in the metropolis, since he had just
jumped into "a qualification," to set himself in
earnest about getting into Parliament: for a seat
then, when Lord Melbourne's premiership seemed to
be held by a very frail tenure, might&mdash;his cockney
friends entreated him to remember&mdash;enable him to
"<i>save</i> the country" for, at least, another year, from
the "merciless grasp" of the Tories. So Mr. Mortimer
set his wits to work, to find out how the
seat was to be gained. He hunted for opinions
wherever he went; but none "took his fancy" so
much as a shrewd hour's advice given him one day,
without a fee, by a lawyer, or a person who said he
was one, and with whom he fell into conversation on
board one of the Richmond steamers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Start a newspaper, sir; that's your only sure
card, for cheapness," said the earnest talking man
who called himself "a solicitor:" "the press gives a
man a power that is irresistible."</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer was struck with the words, and
wondered that he had never, by his own unassisted
thought, alighted on so "tangibly-intelligent an idea,"
as he inwardly and emphatically termed it. But the
"legal gentleman's" next words made him feel still
more confident that he was talking to a man who was
worth listening to:&mdash;a solid matter-of-fact man, and
not a mere fanciful idealist:&mdash;one who surveyed
his ground before he either trod upon it himself, or
recommended others to set their feet upon it.</p>

<p>"And, if I were asked," the said legal gentleman
continued, <i>without</i> being asked,&mdash;"if I were asked
<i>where</i> would you start it? I should say 'Kent,' in
one word. You desire to serve the present administration.
Well: there's Greenwich, and Deptford,
and Woolwich: the naval and military establishments
give the government full sweep there: Chatham,
the same: Deal and Sandwich, no difference:
Dover, as beforesaid: Hythe&mdash;there Marchbanks
(that's the genteel way of pronouncing his name)
can put you in if he likes, for he's a Whig: Canterbury:
Lord Albert Conyngham's going out, and a
Whig's sure to be returned there. In fact, there is
but old Rochester where the Tories are sure; and
Maidstone where the Conservatives can't easily be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
got out. Start a paper on Whig principles in Kent,
sir; and&mdash;this is autumn of Eighteen-Forty&mdash;and,
my word to a thousand pounds! before Forty-one is
out, you will be returned for one or other of the
Kentish boroughs."</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer was quite decided: he declared he
was. And so he buttoned up the breast of his surtout,
and put on his gloves, after pulling them off very
suddenly,&mdash;and began to walk, very energetically,
about the deck of the little packet. The "solicitor"
took care to keep close to his elbow, suggesting, and
then answering, a hundred questions on hops, and
cherries, and wheat, and sanfoin, and clover, and
smuggled spirits and tobacco; and the scores of
"houses to let" at the watering-places, and the company
there, and how it differed at Margate and
Ramsgate, and Dover and Gravesend, respectively;
and, in short, on "all and sundry," the natural and
manufactured productions of "Kent, the first English
county in point of rank," as the legal gentleman
assured Mr. Mortimer it was always esteemed to be.</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer was quite decided: he declared he
was!</p>

<p>"Egad! now I recollect," said the legal gentleman.
"A friend of mine in one of the streets leading into
Cheapside, has, at this very time, a large assortment
of type, with a small handy machine-press, a most
neat affair, I'll assure you! in fact, every thing that
would be suitable for a commencement: they came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
into his hands for a bad debt, and might be had
amazingly cheap."</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer looked just as eager as the solicitor
wished him to look.</p>

<p>"And, if you like," continued the solicitor; "if
you like,&mdash;but 'tis of no consequence if you prefer
new type,&mdash;only that would be most confoundedly
expensive,&mdash;but, if you like,&mdash;I have no doubt I
could get the whole lump,&mdash;I had almost said, dirt-cheap
for you."</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer commissioned the legal gentleman,
in a twinkling, to make the purchase; for he was
decided: he declared he was. So Mr. Mortimer gave
the gentleman his card; and the "solicitor" (who
swore, when he discovered that he had "lost his card-case")
gave Mr. Mortimer his address; and as the
packet was at Westminster Stairs by this time, Mr.
Mortimer got out, and bade "good day," with a
grateful smile, to the "solicitor," who remained in
the boat to land at London Bridge, for the city.</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer dined very heartily, and in most
speechless silence; for he was exceedingly full of
thought, and exceedingly pleased with his good-fortune.
Every thing had fallen out so exceedingly,
so wonderfully lucky. The advice of the legal
gentleman was so intelligent,&mdash;so sensible,&mdash;so deeply
distinguished by common sense, which Dean Swift
(Mr. Mortimer remembered) always said was of
more value than all other kinds of sense put together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
In fact, the man he (Mr. Mortimer) could clearly see
was "up to snuff," and knew all about the mysteries
of government influence, and where it lay, and what
the county produced; and&mdash;every thing! But to
complete his good fortune, to put the crowning mark
upon it, this very man knew where type and a
machine-press was to be had for a mere trifle! so
that he (Mr. Mortimer) had nothing to do but to
write out an advertisement for the Chronicle; and
he <i>would</i> write it out that very afternoon, and take it
to the office himself; and to-morrow morning, within
three hours of the paper being published, no doubt,
half-a-score literary men would be at the door, as
corrivals and competitors for the new editorship.</p>

<p>Thus was Mr. Mortimer ruminating over his third
glass of claret, when the servant's announcement that
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;had called,&mdash;the very legal gentleman whom
Mr. Mortimer left at Westminster Stairs but two
hours before,&mdash;caused him to open his eyes very
wide, and ask the gentleman's name again. The
gentleman was introduced, however, and, with a
world of apologies, but another world of assurances
that it resulted from his zeal to serve Mr. Mortimer,
regretted that he should have intruded at such a
time; but he had bought the machine-press and the
type, for he had run upon his friend in Cheapside
before he reached his own residence, and snapped up
the whole thing before any one else found it, and it
was now actually at the door!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"At the door!" cried Mr. Mortimer,&mdash;"what
door?"</p>

<p>"My dear sir," answered the legal gentleman,
with singular suavity, "I regret exceedingly, as I
have just observed, that I should have intruded at
this particular time; but I knew the highly important
object,&mdash;the national object, as I may say,&mdash;that
you had fixed your mind upon&mdash;admitted of no
delay, and so I went to work <i>instanter</i>. To a gentleman
who is rather unused to these things&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer confessed he <i>was</i> unused to these
things, and felt that he <i>ought</i> to feel grateful, exceedingly
grateful, to the gentleman.</p>

<p>The gentleman begged there might be no apology.&mdash;But
Mr. Mortimer really felt he ought to apologise.&mdash;Yet
the gentleman most particularly begged there
might be no apology; and&mdash;there was the little bill!&mdash;and&mdash;where
would Mr. Mortimer have the goods
put, since they were in a van&mdash;the very first thing,
in the shape of a conveyance, that the gentleman
could see when he had bargained for the type and the
machine-press&mdash;in a van, at the door!</p>

<p>The bill was something more than one hundred
pounds, and&mdash;and&mdash;Mr. Mortimer was staggered,
for he had not calculated on half the sum; but, what
could he say? It would be so disrespectful, so ungrateful,
so ungentlemanlike, to demur to the price
or the purchase; so Mr. Mortimer thanked the gentleman
"most heartily:" he was under very deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
obligations to him: it was what he ought not to
expect from a mere stranger: he would retain a
most grateful sense of the gentleman's kindness.
And he begged the gentleman would be seated; and
would the gentleman take claret, or did he prefer
Burgundy?</p>

<p>The gentleman reminded Mr. Mortimer that the
van was at the door, and it was necessary to say
what was to be done with the goods. He (the "legal
gentleman") had an unoccupied office just now on his
hands, and it was at Mr. Mortimer's service if&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>An English thought shot across Mr. Mortimer's
mind, and he rang the bell, and summoned his landlady.
"Did she know of any upholsterer, or other
tradesman in the neighbourhood, who could take care
of a little furniture that was in the van at the door?"
The landlady replied that she did, and Mr. Mortimer
begged she would see it taken care of, in her own
name.</p>

<p>The legal gentleman looked very sharply and
earnestly at his watch,&mdash;when the landlady withdrew,
and Mr. Mortimer again mentioned the wine. He,
the "legal gentleman," really could not stay at that
particular time: he had acted thus promptly in order
to serve Mr. Mortimer, for he was aware of the vast
importance of promptitude in national affairs, and
Mr. Mortimer's particular business might most emphatically
be termed a national affair, when its ultimate
purpose was considered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer could not press the gentleman
under such circumstances, so began to write out a
cheque for the amount of the bill. A sudden
thought struck him, however, just as he had handed
it to the gentleman.</p>

<p>"We must talk one point over, my dear sir," he
said, "and that is, <i>where</i> must the paper be published?
for you observed that there were already several
small papers of an insignificant character in the
county, and that they were published at different
towns. Now <i>where</i> must my new paper be published,
so as best to compete with one of them?"</p>

<p>The legal gentleman looked as if taken aback for
a moment, but speedily answered, "Why not in
London?"</p>

<p>"Hum!" replied Mr. Mortimer, musingly:
"would not that be rather out of character? Might
not the Kentish people deny that the paper was a
Kentish paper at all, then?"</p>

<p>"Your plan, sir, is this," answered the solicitor,
with the same air of unanswerable decision and discernment
which he wore in the steamer;&mdash;"take a
trip of observation through the whole county for
yourself: it will cost you little, if you go shrewdly
to work; and you will learn much, by the way, that
will be of immense service to you, in the great undertaking
itself: that's the likeliest way to find your
fulcrum, as a clever mechanical friend of mine
always says, and then plant your intellectual lever;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and may it prove successful, sir, is my heart's
best wish, in raising you speedily to the House of
Commons!"</p>

<p>The legal gentleman rounded with a smile; but
his speech needed no gilding for Mr. Mortimer: it
went to the inmost chamber of his brain, with the
speed and power of instant and undisturbable conviction;
and he shook his adviser most fervently by
the hand, and regretted, again and again, that the
gentleman could not stay and spend the evening,
but hoped he would have the pleasure of his company
again, when he, Mr. Mortimer, had completed
the little projected tour. The legal gentleman assured
Mr. Mortimer he would feel honoured in
accepting the invitation, and, with great politeness,
withdrew.</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer's Kentish tour was commenced
the very next morning. He was in the street at
Greenwich, as soon as the first train could arrive
there, in its fifteen minutes' journey from the foot of
London Bridge. Mr. Mortimer could, of course, think
of no step so likely to be taken with a view to obtaining
information, as calling at a respectable business-like
inn. He had made a little inquiry in the railway
carriage; and "The Mitre" and "The Greyhound"
were recommended as highly respectable resorts of
company. Mr. Mortimer bent his steps towards
the Greyhound. He found the landlord to be a
person of very frank and pleasing appearance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of very courteous manners; but it was too early for
company, so the tourist intimated that he would require
dinner at such an hour, and went out to saunter
a few hours about the Hospital and the Park.
There seemed to be much that a person might be
pleased with, he thought, amidst all that he saw;
but his mind was fixed on obtaining information, and
he could see no one walking in the Park, nor about
the Hospital colonnades, that was at all likely, in
his judgment, to tell him any thing about the desirableness
or propriety of starting a newspaper at
Greenwich. He passed several old pensioners, while
in this discontented mood, sitting under the shade of
the noble chestnut trees, some recounting their naval
adventures while turning the quid, or smoking, and
others reading. Suddenly, he observed that a veteran
who was reclining alone was reading a newspaper;
and the whim seized him to make a little inquiry in
the line of his own pursuit, though he thought it a
somewhat unlikely quarter from whence to obtain
the information he was seeking.</p>

<p>"You are busy, I see, my friend," said Mr. Mortimer:
"any particular news, just now?"</p>

<p>"Why no, sir?" answered the veteran, looking
through his spectacles at the person who asked him
the question: "every thing seems very dull, but
you know they always fill the newspapers up with
something,&mdash;what with things that happen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
things that never did happen, and what with things
that they invent, and things that they borrow."</p>

<p>"Do you read the papers much?" asked Mr. Mortimer,
thinking the old man displayed shrewdness
enough to deserve another question.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, I might read 'em more than I do, if
I would," answered the veteran; "but I don't think
it worth the trouble. This is a London paper, and
I see it weekly. They publish two papers in Greenwich
here, but they're neither of 'em worth looking
at, according to my thinking. How they get supported
I can't make out, for nobody thinks any thing
of 'em; yet I heard a person say that there was strong
talk of another being started by some gentleman
that's disposed to fool his money away. 'Tis a pity
but what somebody or other would advise him different,
for it's the wildest scheme in the world, I
think, to imagine that any newspaper can prosper
in a place like this, that's so near London."</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer felt as if he would have dropped
into the earth, and had but just presence of mind
left to bid the old pensioner "good morning," before
he walked away to recover the blow thus given to
his hopes. But he consoled himself by reflecting
that it was a "mere vulgar old man" who had delivered
this opinion,&mdash;one who was not at all likely
to know what chance there was for the success of a
newspaper enterprise, into which so many commercial
and political interests and considerations must needs be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
woven. It must be a matter altogether beyond the
scope and reach of a mere Greenwich pensioner. After
restoring his own confidence in some degree, the tourist
returned to his inn, dined, read the papers, and at
length had the pleasure of seeing the evening company
begin to gather. But Mr. Mortimer was resolved
to make longer preliminary observation this
time, ere he introduced the subject that most nearly
concerned him. He was pleased to find, by attending
to the tone of remarks, as the current subjects
of Mahomet Ali, and Napier, and the Syrian question,
were being discussed, that the two great parties
of Whigs and Tories were fully represented in the
room. He thought this a fortunate circumstance for
himself, since he would be less likely to gather a
biassed decision among the company, on his great
newspaper question, when he thought the time was
come for his introduction of it. And after waiting
long, he <i>did</i> introduce it, cautiously concealing, as he
thought, the fact, that he himself was desirous of commencing
a Kentish paper. But Mr. Mortimer was
not the cunningest man in the world, and more than
one member of the company perceived his purpose
before the close of the conversation.</p>

<p>"Vy, sir, you understand,"&mdash;began a very elderly
person, of a portly figure, who seemed to be held in
great respect by his companions, but who, by his
dialect, had evidently been thrown among the least
cultivated portion of the metropolitan population,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>&mdash;"you
understand, that's a vay o' hembarking
cappitle, as it vere, vich I vouldn't recommend, for
von: for, by the same rule, you understand, another
gen'lmans a-been thinking of it, and I said the same,
you understand, to him."</p>

<p>But Mr. Mortimer did <i>not</i> understand; and he
therefore made no reply.</p>

<p>"But it depends a good deal on the particular
object the individual has in view who embarks the
capital," observed a thin, keen-looking man: "if
Captain Dundas, now, were to start a paper in
Greenwich, it could not fail to answer his purpose."</p>

<p>"By the same rule," interjected the elderly person,
"that's quite another affair, as it vere. The
Captain, you understand,&mdash;and success to him say
I, vith all my 'art!&mdash;the Captain, you understand,
by the same rule, vouldn't care about the paper
paying."</p>

<p>"Exactly," observed the bland landlord, reconciling
the apparent difference of his guests; "so that that
does not disprove your point."</p>

<p>"But pray, gentlemen," asked Mr. Mortimer, "may
I ask what would be the particular object of Captain
Dundas, if he were to start a new paper in your
town?"</p>

<p>"O! Parliament, sir!&mdash;Parliament, of course!"
quickly replied the thin, keen-looking man, with a
very significant shake of the head.</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer's blood beat quick with a rush of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
thoughts; but he resolved to be prudent, and so he
said nothing; but he felt more than ever assured of
the legal gentleman's intelligence who had first recommended
his present errand, and he sank gently
back, when he had sipped largely at his brandy and
water, and pulled away vehemently at his cigar.
"It is indeed the intellectual lever, as the gentleman
said," reflected Mr. Mortimer within himself,
"whereby a man may raise himself to the House
of Commons: every intelligent man thinks so: but
then&mdash;where to plant the fulcrum?"</p>

<p>So Mr. Mortimer rejoined the conversation, which
was now in full tide respecting the relative chances
of a new Whig, and a new Tory paper; and pressed
the question very closely, whether, in the whole
county of Kent, Greenwich were the more likely
place to start a new paper. To this question there
were many answers: one said it was a better place
than Woolwich, where a new paper had just started;
and another compared it with Gravesend; and others
with Canterbury, and Dover; but there was a fair majority
in the room for Greenwich;&mdash;yet, what chiefly
puzzled Mr. Mortimer was the fact, that when he
subjected his own doubt to the consideration of the
company, as to whether the immediate proximity of
Greenwich to London would not militate against the
chances of prosperity for a new Greenwich paper,
there were equal numbers, for and against. One circumstance
particularly gratified Mr. Mortimer: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
thin, keen-looking man strenuously maintained that
the contiguity of Greenwich to London would be,
and was, and must necessarily be, the strongest, the
most advantageous point of view in which the whole
question to be solved could be entered upon. The
thin, keen-looking man said a great deal more,&mdash;but,
somehow or other, Mr. Mortimer understood him
less, the more he talked; and as the hour was advancing
on midnight, Mr. Mortimer withdrew, resolving
to turn the whole conversation over, and make
up his mind in bed.</p>

<p>But Mr. Mortimer did <i>not</i> turn the conversation
over there, for he had smoked and drank too much,
in his earnestness, to keep awake one minute when he
was fairly abed. Yet he dreamt wonderful things about
the "Intellectual Lever,"&mdash;things that warmed and
enraptured his fancy when he woke the next morning;&mdash;but
nothing about the "fulcrum,"&mdash;so that he
gained no help by his dreams towards making up his
mind about publishing at Greenwich. It was "all
right," however, Mr. Mortimer reflected, as he sat
down to breakfast,&mdash;it was all right, that he did not
make up his mind at the outset: it was most judicious
to keep himself, mentally, in equilibrio, until he
had been round the country, completed his tour of
observation, and then put the merits and advantages
of each town side by side,&mdash;so as to enable himself
to draw a correct judgment.</p>

<p>If all Mr. Mortimer's thinkings were to be related,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
his story would be a very long one. Suffice it to
say, that he, forthwith, set out for Lewisham, when
he had breakfasted, and paid his bill, and bidden the
landlord good-morning. From Lewisham Mr. Mortimer
strode on to Bromley; and from Bromley, per
stage-coach, he went to Sevenoaks, and the next day
to Tunbridge, and to the Wells the following day.
This was the route Mr. Mortimer had most sagaciously
chalked out for himself,&mdash;he being thoroughly bent
on making the complete circuit of the county. The
"Intellectual Lever" he took care to mention whereever
he went,&mdash;for he had now fully resolved to give
his projected newspaper that name,&mdash;and he thought
every one looked as pleased with it as he felt himself.
Indeed, every one was delighted during the whole of
this part of Mr. Mortimer's tour with the idea of a
newspaper that was to take up the interests of parts
of the county which, they assured him, had been so
much neglected, notwithstanding they were so highly
important. Equal delight and similar assurances
greeted the ears of the projector at Cranbrook, and
Tenterden, and Ashford, and Hythe, and Folkestone,&mdash;insomuch
that Mr. Mortimer began to feel more
than ever puzzled with the task of arranging, in his
own mind, the astounding claims of importance preferred
by the respectable denizens of the towns
through which he passed,&mdash;ever announcing his design
of planting the "Intellectual Lever"&mdash;when he
should have found a "fulcrum."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>At Dover, Mr. Mortimer made a longer halt, finding
a most agreeable lodging at the Gun Hotel, and
meeting, moreover, advisers of a determined character
for "planting the Intellectual Lever" there: it was
the key of England, these counsellors assured Mr.
Mortimer: it was, really, the only natural "fulcrum"
for the lever, seeing that it received the first continental
news: it was, anciently, of so much importance;
it was about to become of so much importance,
by the formation of a grand new harbour, and by its
new railway connection with London; and, above all,
it sent two members to parliament. Mr. Mortimer
was troubled, for the Dover counsellors assured him
<i>they</i> would have nothing to do with a Greenwich
paper: Greenwich was nothing to them; and as for
the other towns through which the projector had
passed, they only laughed to hear them mentioned.</p>

<p>"It must be Dover," thought Mr. Mortimer;&mdash;yet
he had resolved to act prudently, and so he did
not positively say so; but bidding his earnest advisers
a very earnest farewell, mounted a daily conveyance
for Deal and Walmer. There, he was
assured by all with whom he conversed, that the
"Intellectual Lever" must be published at Dover,&mdash;and
then&mdash;and then&mdash;it could not fail to secure the
<i>entire</i> patronage of Deal and Walmer! Mr. Mortimer
thought the Deal and Walmer people talked somewhat
inflatedly anent their straggling sea-side villages,&mdash;for
so he was inclined to call them: but then, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
reflected again, that they shared with Sandwich in
returning two members to Parliament. To Sandwich
he went, next day; but&mdash;what was the importance
of any town he had visited compared with Sandwich&mdash;in
the eyes of its little population? Mr. Mortimer
was perplexed&mdash;greatly perplexed&mdash;for the little old
town looked, to him, so very unimportant, and the
claims of its inhabitants to political consideration
were so lofty! Dover? yes, they thought Dover
might do,&mdash;or Canterbury; but the "lever" must
be planted in <i>their</i> neighbourhood. In fact, Mr.
Mortimer perceived, clearly enough, that the Sandwichers
would have liked to tell him, plainly, that
Sandwich was the proper "fulcrum" for the "Intellectual
Lever," but very shame withheld them.</p>

<p>The next day, the traveller went on in the same
kind of daily conveyance&mdash;half-cab, half-cart&mdash;to
Ramsgate. The journeying was very pleasant, in
the neighbourhood of the sea, and the company very
cheerful; but they were not of a character to understand
much about levers and fulcrums,&mdash;so Mr.
Mortimer said nothing about either, but listened
rather than conversed.</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer had been perplexed before,&mdash;but
what could describe his perplexity, when he had spent
a day each in Ramsgate and Margate? He was
lectured rather than told,&mdash;by every company he
joined,&mdash;on the absolute, the imperative necessity of
regarding "the Isle of Thanet" in its proper light:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
every body was neglecting it: no one attended to it:
their interests were vanishing: property was becoming
of no value: any petty village in Kent could have
its puffs and its praises, while their towns&mdash;the two
most respectable watering-places in all England&mdash;were
forgotten! Dover?&mdash;nonsense!&mdash;Canterbury
was the place&mdash;if the gentleman did not like to venture
on taking the Isle of Thanet for a fulcrum. But
the gentleman must remain another day, and attend
the grand "annual dinner of the Isle of Thanet," at
the "Ranelagh Gardens;"&mdash;a delightful spot, Mr.
Mortimer was assured it was: the gentleman would
then be able to draw some more accurate conclusion
as to the real importance of their distinct part of
Kent. So Mr. Mortimer staid, and attended the
dinner, and was much pleased, for a time. A London
editor of a newspaper was there, it is true; and drew
a little more attention than Mr. Mortimer was pleased
to see; but then, the editor belonged to a daily paper,
and Mr. Mortimer consoled himself with the belief
that that would not stand in the way of his weekly
"lever," when he had found the fulcrum, and planted
it. But, alack! poor Mr. Mortimer&mdash;how did he
feel during the last three hours of the feast;&mdash;for it
was a protracted midnight affair, according to custom,
elsewhere, in similar "annual" meetings;&mdash;how did
poor Mr. Mortimer feel when, after all the usual
"loyal toasts" had been drunk,&mdash;and the grand toast
of the evening, the "prosperity" toast, came on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>&mdash;an
ambitious Ramsgate-man dared to put the name
of <i>his</i> town before the name of Margate! Thunder
and lightning! Etna and Vesuvius!&mdash;Was there
ever any thing comparable to the rage that followed,
and the denunciation, and the eloquent invective, so far
transcending Chatham and Grattan and Brougham,
and all the wielders of scathing sarcasm that ever
breathed! Ten?&mdash;no! nor twenty pages&mdash;would
not hold the speeches:&mdash;so 'tis to no purpose making
more words about it: Mr. Mortimer was&mdash;to use a
very expressive slang phrase or two&mdash;Mr. Mortimer
was completely <i>flummaxed</i> and <i>flabbergasted</i>; or, as
Jonathan would say&mdash;he was "struck all of a heap!"
Mr. Mortimer's head reeled, and he said nothing,&mdash;no!
not a word, as they crammed him into a carriage
with half-a-dozen more, at midnight, to go back to
Margate; though the reason might, partly, be, that
he had tippled two bottles of sherry, and was asleep:
but, suffice it to say, that, the next morning, Mr.
Mortimer left Margate for Canterbury, more than
ever puzzled with the immense problem of the "relative
importance" of towns in Kent,&mdash;more than
ever in a quandary as to where the true and indisputable
"fulcrum" existed for "planting the intellectual
lever."</p>

<p>Canterbury,&mdash;ah! Canterbury was a city he had
often longed to see, and he had, more than once, half
made up his mind to visit it, for mere curiosity.
But, <i>now</i>, when his brains were in such a whirl with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
thinking about the lever, and finding such alarming
difficulty in discovering the fulcrum&mdash;why he forgot
Becket, and the Black Prince, and St. Augustine,
and deferred all historical inquiries and all sight-seeing,
and asked about nought but newspapers.
"Newspapers, sir!"&mdash;exclaimed the landlord of the
inn at which he alighted,&mdash;"newspapers!&mdash;why,
Lord love ye! we have <i>four</i> published here in Canterbury,
already!"</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer stared more than ever he had stared
in his life. "Four!" he echoed; "four! What sort
o' papers are they, pray?"</p>

<p>"Sort o' papers, sir!" answered the landlord,
"why very capital papers: three of 'em at least,&mdash;them
as is heddited by Mr. Mudford, a werry clever
man, sir."</p>

<p>"Mudford!&mdash;what&mdash;Mudford that used to edit
the Courier?"</p>

<p>"The werry same gen'lman, sir," answered the
cockney landlord.</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer turned pale. "And the other
paper?" he said, by way of question.</p>

<p>"Oh! that, sir, is a low radical affair&mdash;"The Kent
Herald;"&mdash;but I don't belong to that party, though
they're werry strong here; and the paper sells well,
they say."</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer sat down, and tried to think. He
sipped a pint of sherry, and munched a couple of
biscuits, and he <i>did</i> think; for the result was, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
took coach in another hour, and set off for Chatham
and Rochester.</p>

<p>And now, Mr. Mortimer, singularly enough, rose
from zero to fever heat, in his hopes and resolves
about the fulcrum and the intellectual lever. "The
four towns," as the Chatham people told him,&mdash;Strood,
Rochester, Chatham, and Brompton, united
as they were, lying around the basin of the Medway,
filled with trading enterprise, blending so many great
interests,&mdash;the dockyard, the soldiers' barracks, the
hulks, the Dissenters, so all-powerful in Chatham,
the Jew brokers, the cigar smugglers (or makers
rather), the corporation of Rochester and its two
members, and Chatham and its one member of Parliament,
the cathedral, and the castle in ruins,&mdash;were
all thrown upon Mr. Mortimer in such clustered
phrases of inviting importance, that he completely
lost his "rules of prudence," and proclaimed in a
tone very like a shout, and very like Archimedes, only
he didn't speak Greek,&mdash;"I have found it!" Yes:
Mr. Mortimer declared he had found it; found the
fulcrum for the lever, and the new newspaper <i>should</i>
be published at Chatham: the forty thousand inhabitants
of the four towns, he said, were surely able
to support a paper themselves. He was decided, he
declared he was.</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer's resolution was confirmed beyond
the possibility of change, he felt assured, by a little
voyage in the steamer to Sheerness. Chatham was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
"just the place," the Sheerness people assured him,
for the publication of a paper, and <i>they</i> would support
it; in fact, it would have the support of "the <i>whole</i>
Isle of Sheppy!" Mr. Mortimer was exhilarated,&mdash;nay,
he was exultant; and, although he had determined
only to stay an hour in Sheerness, and then
get on board a steamer for returning up the Thames,
he was so pleased that he remained all day, and
drank as hard, in his earnestness, as he had at the
"Ranelagh Gardens" in the Isle of Thanet.</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer had but <i>one</i> call now to make, in
order to complete the line of Kentish survey,&mdash;circle,
rather, which he had so sagaciously laid down for
himself; and he, accordingly, got out at Gravesend,
the next morning, as he was proceeding in the packet
on the Thames. Not that Mr. Mortimer thought
Gravesend of great importance, but it might be as
well, he said within himself, to call there. Unfortunate
Mr. Mortimer! what did he know of the "relative
importance" of the towns of Kent? Landlords,
company, shopkeepers, loungers of all grades, in fact,
every body, insisted that Gravesend was the <i>only</i>
place in Kent where a paper could possibly prosper!
People little thought of the real worth of Gravesend.
"But you have no member of parliament," said poor
Mr. Mortimer, feeling all his old tribulation returning.
What then? it was answered: they had a corporation,
and two piers, and two packet companies, with eternal
war between the piers and the companies,&mdash;war that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
shook the whole bank of the Thames, and was even
perceived to have caused sundry vibrations in London
bridge itself, where "the companies'" packets landed
their passengers. Besides, they had had a paper in
Gravesend once,&mdash;"The Journal,"&mdash;and <i>it</i> prospered;
but no sooner was it removed to Greenwich
than it became worthless. <i>That</i> ought to be a convincing
proof to Mr. Mortimer that Gravesend was
the proper, the <i>only</i> fulcrum for his intellectual lever.
Above all,&mdash;Gravesend was now become "London
in parvo,"&mdash;a fine, well-fed and well-dressed
gentleman observed: genteel people,&mdash;he meant
prosperous merchants,&mdash;removed their families
thither for the entire summer season, and just took
the run with the steamers to London and back,
morning and evening, to transact business: the metropolis
possessed its finest suburb in the rising and
extending and rapidly-improving town of Gravesend!&mdash;and
the company cheered the gentleman's speech
most enthusiastically,&mdash;and, poor Mr. Mortimer! he
was, more than ever, confounded, puzzled, bothered,
perplexed, flummaxed, and flabbergasted! He could
not return to London that day: that was as clear as
the sun at noon,&mdash;although the "fulcrum" question
was become so disastrously dim, since he left Chatham
and Sheerness. Nay, Mr. Mortimer staid at
Gravesend even the whole of the following day; and
the more people he saw&mdash;(and he saw no end of
new faces,&mdash;in fact, they appeared to him, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
puzzled condition, to spring out of the earth&mdash;though
the fact was they came in fresh shoals by the packet
every morning, noon, and night, from town,)&mdash;the
more people he saw, the more he was told that
Gravesend was the place wherein he ought to publish
"The Intellectual Lever:" that <i>there</i> he could lift
all Kent, and get himself returned,&mdash;the conclusion,
he thought, ought to be,&mdash;for any Kentish borough
<i>he chose</i> to represent!</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Mortimer to himself, as he was
dressing on the fourth morning of his stay in Gravesend:
"it <i>is</i> strange&mdash;certainly."</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer would have said more to himself,&mdash;but
he just then happened to be glancing down into
the street, as he was tying his neckerchief, and seeing
an omnibus going by,&mdash;one of the regular and frequent
conveyances from Gravesend to Chatham,&mdash;that
run the eight miles with passengers,&mdash;he read
upon one of its sides&mdash;"Meets conveyances to
<span class="smcap">Maidstone</span>."</p>

<p>"Why, what in the world has possessed me, all
this time?" exclaimed Mr. Mortimer, aloud, although
he was alone,&mdash;"what in the world has possessed
me, that I have been going round Kent, and calling
at every little hole without thinking of Maidstone,&mdash;the
county town, where the assizes are held,&mdash;in
the very core and centre of the shire?"</p>

<p>There was no one to answer Mr. Mortimer,&mdash;but
he was down stairs in another minute,&mdash;besought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
landlord to stop the omnibus,&mdash;paid his bill,&mdash;and
set off, breakfastless, for Maidstone, by way of Chatham.
Mr. Mortimer was resolved he would have his
own unbiassed judgment this time, and so called on
no one at Chatham or Rochester.</p>

<p>Maidstone&mdash;finished Mr. Mortimer! A <i>new</i> newspaper
for Kent?&mdash;why, every one assured him it was
of all schemes the most foolish. The "Maidstone
Gazette," on the Whig side, was edited by Mr.
Whiting, a gentleman of real talent, swarmed with
advertisements, and had a good circulation: the
"Maidstone Journal," on the Conservative side, was
rising into favour and patronage, with its own party:
these were the two <i>real</i> representatives of Kent:
there was no room for another paper: fools might
speculate, in any corner, to please knaves, and throw
their money away: there was no full growth of
radicalism, as in the manufacturing districts: London
was so near at hand that its daily papers and literary
periodicals supplied every want:&mdash;in short, every
man of any pretensions to common sense assured
Mr. Mortimer, if he desired to throw away his fortune,
his projected "lever" was the very instrument to
enable him to throw it away effectually,&mdash;if he chose
Kent for the "fulcrum!"</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer returned to London an altered man.
He believed he had been "humbugged;" and so it
proved. He tried to find "the solicitor," but no such
person was to be found at the house he had pencilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
down on his tablets. "Ah!" thought Mr. Mortimer,
as he returned towards the West end,&mdash;"how lucky
it was that I bethought me not to let the fellow place
the types and the press in his 'office,' as he called it!"
Mr. Mortimer resolved to sell the materials, get back
his hundred pounds, and give up the scheme. He
sent for an appraiser. The press was only fit to
burn, and the types had to be sold for old metal!!&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer is <i>not</i> in parliament yet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<h2>NICHOLAS NIXON, "GENTLEMAN,"</h2>

<p class="center">WHO COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY, BUT
WHO KNEW "IT WAS SO."</p>


<p>Dullness was well nigh at the meridian of her reign
in old Lincoln. In the solemn "precincts" of the
cathedral the humble bees seemed almost afraid to
disturb the solitude by a hum; and venerable maiden
ladies had no vicissitude of existence, save an occasional
scold at their servants, or a grumbling complaint
of "short measure" to the coalman as he made
his weekly call. And, indeed, the rest of the city
was most autumnally tame and uninteresting. The
fashionables were at the watering-places,&mdash;the throng
of the working population was in the fields,&mdash;and
while one tradesman complained, with a yawn, to his
neighbour, that there was "nothing doing, and no
money stirring," the other invariably rejoined, "No,
nor won't be, till after harvest!"&mdash;and then imitated
his neighbour in stretching his mouth from ear to ear.</p>

<p>In fact, the only interesting people you met were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
those who endeavoured to keep you awake by collecting
and pouring out several dull, disagreeable, or
doleful subjects in a breath; such as the relation of
the robbery of such a tradesman's shop at noon-day,&mdash;the
thieves having taken advantage of the extreme
dullness of the time to effect their villainous scheme;&mdash;or,
the accident of the poor-fellow, the bricklayer's
assistant, falling from the top of his ladder, with the
hod on his head, and being taken up to the hospital;&mdash;coupled
with the "remarkable fact" that he was
the second husband of a poor woman whose first fell
from a pear-tree, and was killed, leaving her with
a large family;&mdash;with an additional half-score of
disasters, if your nerves or inclination would permit
you to stay and learn the sum-total of the catalogue.</p>

<p>Nicholas Nixon, "gentleman," had dwelt threescore
years in the venerable city; that is to say, the whole
of his life, and had kept decent state as a householder
among the genteel people of the Minster-yard, for at
least half of the term. Living "retired," on a yearly
income, and passing each successive day of his existence
in an almost unvaried routine of eating,
washing, dressing, walking, and sleeping, one would
have thought that all seasons of the year would have
become equally agreeable or indifferent to him. But
Mr. Nixon was too true a Minster-yard cit either to
feel or to affect indifference in a matter that, he knew,
drew forth so much dull comment among his fellow-citizens,
as did the dullness of the autumn season.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Subdean," said he to that cathedral
dignitary, as he overtook him, by the County Hospital,
at the top of the "Steep Hill," in the forenoon
of one of these drowsy days, "I think our autumns
grow duller and duller every year: I'm sure you must
feel it to be a bore that you are in residence this
latter end."</p>

<p>"I feel it to be a little dull to be among you, at
this time of the year, Mr. Nixon," replied the subdean,
"but still it is an agreeable change."</p>

<p>"I am glad you can think so, sir," rejoined Gentleman
Nixon;&mdash;for that was the mode by which he
was usually distinguished from the several tradesmen
Nixons who inhabited the city,&mdash;"I am glad you can
bring yourself to think so: for my own part, I feel it
to be very dull, very dull, indeed!&mdash;Are you for a
walk to the Bar, sir?"</p>

<p>"I am, Mr. Nixon: shall I have the pleasure of
your company?" was the rejoinder of the courteous
and kind-natured clergyman.</p>

<p>"I shall be most happy, Mr. Subdean: I feel very
highly honoured, sir: I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what is the best news, stirring, Mr. Nixon?"
asked the subdean, desirous of cutting short the retired
gentleman's flourish of politeness.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," answered Mr. Nicholas, very quickly,
"I think the best news is that the poor freemen have
had the spirit to stop this mushroom scheme of the
town council to turn the West Common into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
botanical garden. They are a mischievous set, these
Below-hill Whig-radicals, depend upon it, Mr.
Subdean: we shall have need to look sharp after 'em."</p>

<p>The churchman was full well acquainted with
Gentleman Nixon's undeviating adherence to the
"Pink" partisanship,&mdash;that is to say, Sibthorpian, or
"House-of-Canwick" side of politics, which was most
prevalent "Above-hill"&mdash;the division of old Lincoln
comprising the habitations situate around the ancient
castle and magnificent cathedral, and beyond which the
Roman city did not extend. The subdean, I say,
knew well that Mr. Nixon was among the most unchanging
of the well-nigh changeless denizens in this
elevated region: he knew that Mr. Nicholas professed
the highest, the most exclusive toryism; and therefore
he showed no signs of surprise at the uncharitable
manner in which Mr. Nicholas chose to express himself
upon the question of the political morality displayed
by the citizens dwelling in the lower region;
and yet the clergyman, by one gentle word, excited
great surprise in Mr. Nicholas Nixon.</p>

<p>"I really don't think the new corporation are
intentionally mischievous," said he; "I have no
doubt they mean well: 'tis reckoned to be an age of
improvements, you know, Mr. Nixon, and they must
be in the fashion."</p>

<p>"'Pon my honour, sir, I don't understand the rule
by which you distinguish between mischievous deeds
and intentions," sharply observed Mr. Nicholas: "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
always think that when a number of men deliberately
attempt mischief they mean it."</p>

<p>"I think their scheme would have been less objectionable
had they proposed that each of the poor
freemen should have cultivated a little plot of garden
ground for himself on the common," observed the
churchman, by way of parrying the citizen's strong
remark.</p>

<p>"But the law would not permit that, in my
opinion, any more than the other," said the retired
gentleman: "besides, the fact is just this, sir: once
permit these reforming gentry to begin their schemes
of improvement, and one acre after another would
disappear from the corporate tenure of the freemen,&mdash;until,
the property becoming individual, it would
quickly be bought for a dog's price, by one or other
of these liberals who have longer purses and more
knavish heads than the rest of their neighbours."</p>

<p>"I hope none of the new corporation are such
men as you are speaking of," said the subdean: "you
know, Mr. Nixon, I neither go along with them nor
their party; but I do not like to be uncharitable."</p>

<p>"Uncharitable! nonsense, sir!" exclaimed the
exclusive cit, forgetting his courtesy, through bigoted
partisanship: "I do not hold these fellows to be at
all deserving of a charitable opinion, for I believe
them capable of any wickedness. Why, sir, as Mr.
Christopher shrewdly observed on the hustings in the
castle-yard at the last county contest, while he pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to the venerable Minster, 'These fellows would turn
that sacred and time-hallowed building into a cotton-mill
to-morrow if they had the power.' I believe he
hit the mark there, sir, for he made the liberals very
sore, I assure you," and Mr. Nicholas Nixon chuckled
with a vindictive pleasure as he ended.</p>

<p>"If I did not excuse Mr. Christopher from a knowledge
of the rash speeches which excitement and
opposition impel country gentlemen to deliver on
the hustings," rejoined the clergyman, looking somewhat
grave, "I could not hesitate to censure him for
making so offensive a remark. I do not see any
good to be done by this fierce spirit of quarrel&mdash;but
much evil."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mr. Subdean," persisted Gentleman
Nixon, "but I really must say that I think if all of
us were as tamely disposed as yourself, the church
would soon tumble over your ears."</p>

<p>"I think nothing can tend to build it up so
securely, Mr. Nixon," returned the dignitary, with a
smile, "as showing the world that we, as ministers of
the church, are the truest friends of mankind,&mdash;the
readiest and most cheerful toilers for human happiness.
You know I never like to talk politics, in any
shape; I would much rather hear you and other gentlemen
propose some plan for making the poor more
comfortable in their circumstances,&mdash;or join you in
any little scheme for amusing them. Do you attend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the concerts of these young working-men in St.
Peter's church, Mr. Nixon?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I take the liberty to tell you plainly," persevered
the heated "Pink" partisan, "that the easy
good-nature of such kind-hearted people as yourself,
and the indolence of our most respectable citizens
Above-hill, go far to make it nearly impossible,
already, to recover any degree of influence in city
affairs. We are almost a lost party: the Blues have it
all their own way,&mdash;and although you must be aware
they are bent on ruining the poor entirely, under the
mask of helping them, yet you will not lend a hand
to oppose them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But am I not telling you, my dear sir," interrupted
the subdean, "that I think all the quarrels
in the world can never convince mankind&mdash;the poor
as well as the rest&mdash;that the quarrellers are the
friends of mankind? If the Blue party be so bitterly
bent on ruining the poor, as you say they are&mdash;let
us carry relief into the houses of the poor always in
the spirit of benevolence, and never as an act to
oppose a party. If we look at the very persons we
have to relieve, I think we may learn to do this,&mdash;for
indeed, Mr. Nixon, there is no denying but that the
poor are much more skilful in discerning the motives
of those who visit them with charitable professions,
than they were some years ago."</p>

<p>"Why, sir, what with Methodist cant on the one
hand, and demagoguism on the other, the poor are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
spoilt," replied Mr. Nicholas, in the same tart spirit:
"they have the impudence, now-a-days, to pry into
the conduct of all ranks and conditions: your cloth
does not screen you from their envious inquisitiveness;
and they make all kinds of offensive and sneering
remarks on respectable people. And then, their
pride! Why now, Mr. Subdean, here we are, nearly
at St. Botolph's bar, and not a single poor man has
paid you a mark of respect, all the way we have
walked! Take my word for it, sir,&mdash;forty years ago
if I had been honoured to walk down the street with
a cathedral dignitary, I should have seen every poor
man that we met touch his hat to him! I ask you,
sir, what is to come of such a state of things?" concluded
Mr. Nicholas, in a very earnest and emphatic
tone.</p>

<p>The churchman fairly burst into laughter; and
had it been any other than a Minster grandee, Gentleman
Nixon would have been highly irritated by
his mirth. As it was, he began to suspect himself of
folly, for having carried his opposition to such an extremity
in a merely friendly dialogue.</p>

<p>"Come now, Mr. Nixon," resumed the subdean,
in a tone of pleasant expostulation, "does not this
very circumstance, of the striking change in manners
that you have alluded to, convince you that the hostile
course is unwise? Do you expect, now, that the
poor can be brought to observe the same outwardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
submissive courtesies that their fathers practised when
you and I were young?"</p>

<p>"Well, I must confess, I do not," tardily&mdash;but
perforce of conviction&mdash;Mr. Nicholas made answer.</p>

<p>"It would be foolish to expect it, Mr. Nixon,"
continued the clergyman; "and as they will continue
to keep the course they have commenced outwardly,
so will they grow in the habit of scrutinising the conduct
of those above them. I think the time is nearly
at hand when neither Blues nor Pinks, nor any other
shade of political party, will be able to raise excitements
by attempting to persuade the poor, that these
are designing to cheat them, while those are their disinterested
and sympathising friends. The times are
changed, for the English people are changed: we
cannot deny it, since we have here a proof of it, Mr.
Nixon."</p>

<p>"That we have, too truly, Mr. Subdean!" echoed
Mr. Nicholas, and sighed very dolorously.</p>

<p>"Nay, I do not think there is any cause for regret,
in all this," observed his cheerful and more enlightened
acquaintance; "whatever severe causes may
have operated to produce it, no philanthropist can
regret that there is discernible the commencement of
a spirit of self-respect on the part of the poor. We
are all equal in the sight of our Maker, you know,
my friend; and for my part I assure you, I do not
desire that the old usages of servility should be resumed,
and the great first law of human brotherhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
be again lost sight of&mdash;for, I suspect, that was too
often the fact while the brother in superfine cloth received
such frequent obeisance from the brother in
ragged linen."</p>

<p>"I must again say you surprise me greatly, sir,"
observed Gentleman Nixon, beginning again to
recover his belligerent humour.</p>

<p>"But <i>do not</i> be surprised, Mr. Nixon," answered
the churchman, instantly and persuasively: "the
world has changed, though you remain an honest
Tory, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you have become a Whig, sir, I fear," observed
Mr. Nicholas, while his face and throat began
to assume the hue of a distempered turkey-cock.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Nixon, a Conservative, if you please."</p>

<p>"All the same," said the retired gentleman, but
with a subsidence of his mettle; "scarcely any thing
but a distinction without a difference."</p>

<p>"To speak the broad truth," resumed the clergyman,
"there are but very few now, who boast themselves,&mdash;as
you do, Mr. Nixon, most honestly,&mdash;to
be Tories. Nor are you very far from right in your
belief of the resemblance of some other parties,&mdash;for
the old Whig and the modern Conservative are nearly
akin. The modern Whig would also have been a
Radical some few years ago, while the hotter advocates
for change have also considerably enlarged their
demands."</p>

<p>"And do you pretend to tell me, Mr. Subdean,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
asked Mr. Nicholas, very impatiently, "that you and
others are any other than madmen to yield to this
jacobinical spirit of change?&mdash;I say jacobinical&mdash;the
plain word that my father used, and that I believe
to be the best word."</p>

<p>"But I do <i>not</i> believe it to be the best word, my
dear sir," repeated the subdean, and took the hand of
the retired gentleman with a smile,&mdash;seeing they
were about to separate; "I believe we should be
madmen indeed if we did not yield wisely to this
spirit of change. You will never find me among the
advocates of rash and hasty changes, Mr. Nixon; but
I repeat&mdash;change has begun,&mdash;and if we do not yield
to it wisely, it will speedily proceed more rashly and
hastily than any of us would wish to see. All parties
are amalgamating, for they are blending names; and
all ranks are converging to a common point, where
rank will be forgotten. Forty years ago you could
not have imagined that a cathedral dignitary would
have walked from the 'Chequer Gate to St. Botolph's
Bar, and not one of the hundreds of poor men he met
ever touch their hat to him;&mdash;and yet you have
walked with me every inch of the way this morning,
and seen every poor man pass by without showing
the subdean any more respect than he shows to one
of his ragged neighbours:&mdash;you have seen this, Mr.
Nixon, and you cannot deny that <i>it was so</i>. Good
morning, sir!"</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir!" echoed Mr. Nicholas Nixon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
though it was somewhat vacantly. And thrice he
turned to look after the clergyman when they had separated,&mdash;stunned
and confounded as he felt at what
the dignitary had said; and then wondered how it
could be! But the more Mr. Nicholas wondered, the
less he could comprehend what he wondered at. He
knew that he himself was what he was thirty years
ago,&mdash;the same old-fashioned Tory, who, even then,
lived each day alike, in the same house in the Minster-yard;
but as for the subdean and many others,
though he perceived they had changed, he could not
comprehend why:&mdash;all that he could comprehend
was,&mdash;that <i>it was so</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>SIGNS OF THE TIMES;</h2>

<p class="center">OR,<br />
ONE PARSON AND TWO CLERKS.</p>


<p>It was at the very time,&mdash;for History is notoriously
fond of synchronisms for her greatest events,&mdash;witness
Mycale and Platæa, fought and won on
the self-same day,&mdash;it was at the very time that
Papineau and the Canadian rebels took up swords
and guns to resist Sir John Colborne and the English
troops,&mdash;that the old women of Stow, in the
parts of Lindsey, took up eggs to pelt the parish
parson!</p>

<p>All the world knows, or if it doth not know it has
profited but little by the industry of antiquarians,
that Stow, in the division of Lindsey, and eight miles
north-and-by-west of Lincoln, was an ancient Roman
station, under the euphonic appellation of <i>Sidnacester</i>;
that under that name it was the seat of a
Saxon bishopric; that although Remigius de Fes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>champ,
one of the Norman tyrant's fighting churchmen,
transferred the seat of the diocese to Lincoln,
yet when the stately cathedral which he
founded was finished, while they placed his episcopal
effigy on one of the grand pinnacles of the imposing
west front, they fixed the grotesque image of "the
Swineherd of Stow" (holding in his hand the horn
which he gave filled with silver pennies, towards
building the Minster,) on the other; that the episcopal
palace of Stow was the favourite residence of
the bishops of Lincoln down to the close of the fourteenth
century, and that Stow still gives title to
an archdeacon; lastly, that its venerable-looking
church, dedicated to the blessed Virgin, constructed
in the form of the Holy Rood, and adorned with a
west door of decayed Gothic grandeur, is, to this day,
called "the Mother of Lincoln Minster."</p>

<p>Now such being the distinctions of Stow itself, of
course the "Perpetual Curate" of Stow, on receiving
the awful impressment of episcopal hands, and the
mysterious investiture of canonical habits, together
with the comfortable appointment of the patron to
the vacant curacy, entered on the discharge of his
spiritual functions with strong notions of the altitude
of his office, and of the plenary powers attached
thereto. The ideas of the governed, however, in
these days, somehow or other, don't happen to preserve
an equal altitude, respecting office, with those
of the governors; and the new Perpetual Curate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Stow, the successor to the once vice-regal priests of
Sidnacester, was stricken with ghostly astonishment
at finding that sundry rustics of his parish cared not
a bodle for his new authority; that they snapped
their fingers at his counsel and reproofs; and, setting
at nought his college learning, preferred lending their
ears to the unlearned Wesleyan local preachers,&mdash;a
race of heretics who are so vulgar and unfashionable
as to follow the example of Paul, and other vulgar
workers of old, who earned their bread with the
labour of their own hands, and yet, occasionally, ministered
in word and doctrine. In the very nature
of things this was unsavoury to a clergyman,&mdash;especially
to a young one,&mdash;but more especially to
one who actually stood in the shoes, speaking spiritually,
of the princely and potential bishops of
Sidnacester: it was not for him, above all established
teachers in the shire, to endure such contemptuous
preferences, and by that endurance permit heresy to
bud and blossom unchecked.</p>

<p>Now, a neighbouring reverend brother of his, the
fox-hunting shepherd of Willingham, was also very
grievously pestered with these energetic heretics,&mdash;and
he had resorted to the ancient evangelical custom
of thundering forth anathemas against them from his
pulpit: but that only seemed to render the pestiferous
teachers more successful,&mdash;so the Perpetual Curate
of Stow resolved to exert the whole power of his wit
in discovering some effectual way of doing, what his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
zealous and pious brother of Willingham could not
do,&mdash;driving out heresy, and subduing the rebellious
spirit of his flock. So to work the Perpetual Curate
went with his wit, and a profound mine he wrought:
such a mine as would, no doubt, have blown up
heresy for ever in his parish, had he ever been able
to put the match to it: so profound, that, since his
scheme was frustrated, no one has ever been able to
fathom it, and, therefore, <i>nobody</i> can tell <i>anybody</i> what
it really was. But how was it that a scheme so
profound, so workmanlike, so masterly, did not succeed?
Alas! how often in this frail humanity of
ours do the most exalted enterprises fail, yea, often
by the unexpected resistance of the very instruments
on which we think we can most unerringly and safely
depend! And thus it was with the great Perpetual
Curate: he was most magnanimously bent on subduing
revolt and heresy, when, lo! even Sir Amen,
his clerk, lifted up his heel against him!</p>

<p>Now this was a notable event of a very auspicious
character for the revolters. Clerk William Middleton
was no ordinary clerk. Gervase Middleton, his
father, had been clerk before him. Clerk William
Middleton had, therefore, an important hereditary
stamp upon him. And then, he was a <i>schollard</i>, as
the old women called it, and was so gentle, that he
was never known to hurt a worm; so moral, that he
was never seen drunk in his life; so religious, that
he never used a stronger oath than "Marry good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
faith!" and "By'r Lady!" (old oaths of popish times
that are not yet lost in old Lincolnshire); and so upright,
that he would not deny his conscience, even for
the parson! This was no ordinary auxiliary on the
side of the enemy; and there was no wonder that it
put the Perpetual Curate, for a while, to his wit's
end, to hear the reports which were brought to him
by one Spurr (who was spurred on by his own inward
aims to reach Sir Amen's office), of the stout
and unflinching and open assertions made in the
streets of Stow, by Clerk William Middleton, that
the Methodists had as much right to preach as the
parson! It was heresy he did not expect from such
a quarter; but he was resolved he would be even
with this member of the revolt, however; so he
played a master-stroke so suddenly, that it shook the
whole parish like an earthquake: he actually <i>un</i>-clerked
Clerk William Middleton, the son of Clerk
Gervase, the old, learned, hereditary, gentle, moral,
upright, pious, and religious parish-clerk!!!</p>

<p>This was a most unprecedented and most unexpected
event; and it gave rise, as may be guessed it
would, to a mighty concatenation of stupendous occurrences.
The spirit of the Perpetual Curate was
roused, and his genius, too, as was proved by his
statesmanlike blow at the ring-leader of the rustic
confederacy; and the spirit of the parishioners was
roused likewise, for they were determined that, although
the parson might appoint a new clerk, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
would stick by the old one. The ensuing Sunday,
accordingly, brought forth the strange anomaly of <i>one</i>
parson with <i>two</i> clerks, reading the church service in
the ancient aisle of Stow! Moreover, when the
<i>chosen</i> of the Perpetual Curate was beheld to be the
egregious tale-bearer and notorious sycophant, Spurr,
who was no adept at the letters of his prayer-book,
the churchwarden and parishioners were alike wroth,
and resolved, still more resolutely, on abiding by
their old respected utterer of amens, Clerk William
Middleton, the son of Clerk Gervase. Thus it fell
out that Clerk Spurr,&mdash;we know not, nor care we,
what was his pronomen, or "christened" name, as
they call it in Lincolnshire; whether it were Moses
or Mahershalalhashbaz, Nahum or Nebuchadnezzar,
Jeremiah or Judas Iscariot, we cannot tell,
nor doth it concern the dignity of this our record, to
say with positiveness,&mdash;for the fellow was but as a
buzzard to a sparrow-hawk, when compared with the
rightful clerk; but thus it fell out, that Clerk Spurr
was called "the Parson's Clerk," while Clerk William
Middleton, the son of Clerk Gervase, bore the
creditable and legitimate epithet of "the Parish
Clerk."</p>

<p>And, then, it came to pass that, when announcements
of christenings, burials, or marriages, had to
be made, the parishioners, in the spirit of their preference,
commissioned their own clerk, "the Parish
Clerk," to inform his Reverence the Perpetual Curate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of the same, and to request the fulfilment of the
accustomed rites. But the cooler the parishioners
grew towards "the Parson's Clerk," the hotter did
the parson grow towards his parishioners. He scorned
to compromise his sacerdotal dignity by attempting a
reconciliation with the unruly spirits by which he
was surrounded: he spurned the ignoble example of
the ancient worthies who thought the first and last
part of Christianity was meekness and long-suffering;
and he meditated a still more afflictive stroke of retaliation
on his spiritual rebels.</p>

<p>Clerk William Middleton conveyed a request to
his spiritual superior from a sorrowing villager to bury
his dead child;&mdash;but the grand Perpetual Curate
would not fulfil the request because it was brought
him by the discarded, though old, hereditary Amen,&mdash;and
adjourned, in dudgeon, to the hamlet of Coates,&mdash;while
the poor villager's child was put into its
grave,&mdash;as every child of such rebels deserved to be
put,&mdash;<i>like a dog</i>,&mdash;without a prayer being read, or
a hope expressed about its resurrection!</p>

<p>This circumstance sank deeply into the minds of
the Stow revolters: it was a something that had never
been heard of a clergyman in the memory of man,&mdash;at
least at Stow in the parts of Lindsey: it made
their skin creep, and the very "hair of their flesh to
stand up,"&mdash;for they were simple, unsophisticated
sort of people, and, therefore, all strong mental emotions
had the same effects upon their physical frames,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
as the author of "Job" and Homer describe in their
days. But the strong feeling did not evaporate
through the pores of their skin, especially with the
more noble, though tenderer, sex: <i>they</i> laid their
heads together to do such a deed upon a parson as
had never been done upon one since the name of
parson had been known in Stow. In a short time
another message had to be despatched to the Perpetual
Curate: a woman had to be churched, and a
child to be buried, on the same afternoon,&mdash;and,
judging from the former example, the villagers conjectured
that his Reverence would "make himself
scarce" after the churching, and leave this child, also,
unburied. And now, a valorous army of the female
gender, their pockets plentifully provided with plenipotent
ammunition of eggs, formed themselves, in heroic
ambuscade, near the church door, purposing right
courageously to assail the clerical enemy, if he should
haughtily refuse the offices of Christian sepulture to
the deceased child. "Enterprises of great pith and
moment," however, as the immortal one saith, often
"their currents turn awry, and lose the name of
action." So it was in this ambuscade so gloriously
planned. The clerical enemy wisely capitulated: his
clerk, "the Parson's Clerk," preceded the Perpetual
Curate from the church, as a herald of moderation,
assuring the armed battalion that his reverence would
peaceably inter the child; and, forthwith, some of
the gallant troop immediately <i>grounded</i> their arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
while others preferred <i>throwing</i> them to a distance,&mdash;in
token that they put away all hostile thoughts far
from them.</p>

<p>And here, perchance, this chivalrous history might
have ended, had not the demon of Litigation, who
was doubtless hovering near the field of intended
affray, taken the case into his own foul hands. Some
part of the rejected artillery chanced to alight upon
the garments of "the Parson's Clerk's" wife, and of
the Perpetual Curate's servant-maid. It was in vain
that the members of the ambuscade protested this
mishap to be owing in no degree to their intent:&mdash;the
parson commenced an action at law against the
entire petticoat regiment, or its ringleaders, for
"assault and battery."</p>

<p>Another untoward event thickened the quarrel,
and doubled the action at law; but the event itself
cannot be so distinctly related as the last, seeing it
occurred in the dark, while the female ambuscade
was planted by broad daylight. The successor of the
bishops, bearing a staff instead of a crosier, and his
chosen Amen, bearing a hayfork, chanced to meet
two youths connected with the revolters, one evening
after dusk, in the churchyard. Who gave the primal
assault cannot be positively affirmed, for it is not over
safe to speak closely after the parties in a squabble,
when there are no other witnesses. However, a
fight certainly took place, even among the tombs of
the dead; and so high did the wrath of the belligerent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Clerk Spurr rise in the conflict, that a cottager,
neighbouring to the church, heard with alarm, even
at his own door, the said clerkly warrior threaten to
stab his opponent with the hayfork! Ere the cottager
could quit his door, up came the parson and
demanded help; but the cottager honestly told the
parson "he would look better at home." His Reverence
then sought "help" at the blacksmith's shop,
but there, also, no one thought he needed it,&mdash;and
so he retreated to his lodgings.</p>

<p>Such, in a few words, was the cause of the double
action at law; and, at the ensuing Kirton sessions,
the two youngsters who had either cudgelled the
parson, or had been cudgelled themselves, together
with the ringleaders of the famous female ambuscade,
were together tried for "assault and battery."
But the wrathful parson did not get his will: the
affair was so ludicrous that he was compelled to
consent that it should be "hushed up."</p>

<p>To hush up the heart-burnings of the parties, on
their return to the seat of war, was, however, not so
easy a matter. Above all things, did it now become
a difficult task to keep peace between the rival clerks.
Passing by the many minor occasions wherein fiery
frowns and black glances were exchanged, this history,
which we must abridge, through dread of being
adjudged tedious, conducts us to another notable
event, which became the subject of <i>another</i> "action-at-law,"
at a succeeding Kirton Quarter Sessions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The funeral of a parishioner was about to take
place, and the friends of the deceased "particularly
requested" that Clerk William Middleton, the son of
Clerk Gervase,&mdash;the true "Parish Clerk,"&mdash;the
old, hereditary, and established, and legitimate pronouncer
of conclusive amens,&mdash;might give the
responses at this funeral. Clerk Spurr, the "Parson's
Clerk," however, determined on contesting the
point;&mdash;and&mdash;a struggle for the old folio prayer-book
actually took place in the church!</p>

<p>Here, again, was a sight that had never been
beheld, or dreamt of, before, in the parish of Stow:
but as strange and indecorous a sight as it was, it
was one that many a rural spectator declared he
wouldn't have missed for a quart of ale!&mdash;The very
mourners for the dead were compelled to hide their
laughing faces with their white handkerchiefs,&mdash;for
the grotesque wrestling of the rival clerks, and their
looks of rage, as they together grasped and tugged
at the prayer-book, put weeping out of the question.
The parson had got through&mdash;"I said I will take
heed to my ways,"&mdash;and wanted to begin&mdash;"Lord,
thou hast been our refuge,"&mdash;but there stood
the wrestlers, grasping, and pulling, and panting,
and sweating,&mdash;and it was a most difficult thing
to say which would be likely to beat. Many a
stout farmer that shook his sides,&mdash;for the laugh
became broad and general, in spite of the solemnity
of the occasion,&mdash;longed to shout out, "A crown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
a groat upon Middleton!"&mdash;but restrained himself.
At length,&mdash;the genuine, hereditary spirit of the
true "Parish Clerk" prevailed!&mdash;he possessed the
book: the "Parson's Clerk" sought a seat, to
take his breath;&mdash;and Clerk William, panting, and
wiping the streaming perspiration from his comely
and heroic brow, proceeded to echo the "Confession"
after the Perpetual Curate.</p>

<p>Such was the cause of the "action" brought by
Spurr (at the direction, and by the ghostly advice
of the Perpetual Curate) against Middleton at the
succeeding sessions,&mdash;an action of "assault committed
by the said Middleton upon him the said Spurr,
while in the performance of duty." The jury, on
this occasion,&mdash;to make short of the narrative,&mdash;sat
till eleven at night,&mdash;the Court rang with laughter
for hours,&mdash;and the affair was, at last, got rid
of,&mdash;by some legal resort, and Spurr (or his
advisers) were saddled with costs. <i>That</i> was a
conclusion that "gravelled" Spurr, as he said, on
leaving the Court; and the Perpetual Curate was
also "gravelled"&mdash;though he did not use the same
expression; and they each showed it, soon after their
second return to the old seat of war. But another
slight event must first be chronicled, ere the several
succeeding and exalted doings of the "Parson's
Clerk" and the Perpetual Curate are narrated.</p>

<p>Thomas Skill, was a skilful yeoman of good report,
holding two farms in the ancient parish of Stow;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and although he eschewed all heresy and dissent,
and willed to worship after the fashion of his forefathers,&mdash;who
had been creditable yeomen in Stow
from time immemorial,&mdash;yet liked he not of the
wayward doings of his Reverence the Perpetual
Curate. Now it chanced that on a certain Sunday
in November that the said Skill the skilful went, as
was his pious and religious wont, to pay his devotions
<i>according to law</i>, in the parish church of Stow, the
ancient and venerated sanctuary of his forefathers.
As a holder of two farms, be it observed, this creditable
yeoman had a right, by the customs of this rural
district, to <i>two</i> pews; nevertheless, being by no
means a person of an unreasonable disposition, he was
content, on that day, to occupy but <i>one</i>, if so be that
he might be allowed to worship quietly. Nevertheless,
scarcely was he seated, ere a certain Jesse Ellis,
an aged man of some rural rank as a master-husband-man
who had been selected by the Perpetual Curate
as <i>his</i> churchwarden, came up to the pew-door, said
"he was <i>ordered</i> to pull Skill out," and, forthwith,
attempted to put the "order" into execution. Did
Skill the skilful resist?&mdash;Did he yield? No, no: he
knew a trick worth two of either. He had not his
name for nought! When Ellis laid his grasp vehemently
on the pew-door, skilful Skill held it fast for
a few moments, and then skilfully let it go,&mdash;all in
a moment,&mdash;so that the vehement Ellis, by the vehemence
of his grasp and the rebound of the pew-door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
was overthrown; and there he lay,&mdash;he, the parson's
own churchwarden,&mdash;on the floor of the aisle of
Stow church, in the time of "divine service," with
the congregation from their seats and pews, and the
Perpetual Curate, from his reading-desk, and Clerk
Spurr, the "Parson's Clerk," and Clerk William
Middleton, the son of Clerk Gervase, squeezing one
another in the desk below, and yet looking on, and
all looking on, at his signal defeat and overthrow:
there he "lay vanquished&mdash;confounded;"&mdash;like
Milton's Satan, sprawling on the "fiery gulf,"
when all the fallen angels were sprawling there likewise,
but yet looking on and shaking their heads at
him for a rash captain&mdash;no doubt!</p>

<p>Then appeared Skill the skilful, and Ellis the
sprawler, before a bench of "Her Majesty's Justices
of the Peace for the parts of Lindsey," in the Moothall
of Gainsborough; where the justices acted with
sense and discernment, and dismissed the sprawler's
suit, saddling him with costs. An end might have
come to this episode here; but the sprawler and his
son were people of spirit, and were so much dissatisfied
with this decision of the justices, that they went
home muttering all the way about <i>law</i>, and declaring
to every one they met, that they "would <i>yet have it</i>."
And so skilful Skill thought it wise and prudent to
let them "have it;" and, therefore, from mere neighbourly
good humour, commenced his action, in turn,
against the said Jesse Ellis for attempting to pull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
him out of his own pew, on the said Sunday in November,
and in the parish church of Stow aforesaid.
Our manuscript hath, in this place, an hiatus; so
that we cannot say how the said action terminated:
but it will not excite wonder that amidst the ravelled
tissue of broils and litigations occasioned by the
gospel-mindedness of the illustrious successor to the
Sidnacestrian prelates, some of their issues should
escape complete and satisfactory chronicle.</p>

<p>It behoveth, moreover, that we now attend to the
more lofty department of this our history of ecclesiastical
revolutions,&mdash;for, as the sun transcendeth
the stars, so do the acts of sacerdotal personages outshine
the brightest deeds of the vulgar laity.</p>

<p>And first, of the continued luminous acts and
deeds of Clerk Spurr, the notable and notorious
"Parson's Clerk," the hero of the hayfork. Let none
imagine that he always warred with such a vulgar
weapon of the field; forasmuch as his Reverence the
Perpetual Curate, being in possession of a grand
double-barrelled gun, was wont to commit and intrust
it to the lawful custody of his worthy coadjutor in
heroic exercises, the heroic Clerk Spurr. Neither
did it redound a little to the credit of the Perpetual
Curate's humanity, that he did so commit and intrust
the said formidable piece of ordnance to the
custody of the said Spurr;&mdash;forasmuch as the life
and safety of that hero of the hayfork were discerned
to be seriously in danger,&mdash;inasmuch as it had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
proven how the malicious urchins of the community,
participating deeply in the heart-burnings of their
sires and mothers, were wont often to annoy, with
sundry small pebbles and other mischief-working
missiles, the precious person of the said hero. Lest,
therefore, these assaults should issue in some bodily
harm to himself, the man of nightly valour was
equipped with the gun, and speedily proceeded to
defend himself therewith, in the manner that shall
now be described and related, together with the
fruition of his new act of heroism.</p>

<p>The night was two hours old,&mdash;no moon, no
stars,&mdash;it was deeply dark and murkily cloudy, and&mdash;but
never mind all that! Anon, up cometh the
troop of youngsters, whispering laughter, and saying
"Hush!" to each other, as they approach the camp
of the enemy. Little thought they, as they marched
along, each laden with his pocket of pebbles, of the
sore discomfiture which had been planned for them
by the foe! Clerk Spurr, that signal warrior of the
implement with prongs, had planted himself, firelock
on shoulder, eye full of aim, and heart full of valour,
close by the usual point of attack. The besiegers
halt,&mdash;and, in a moment, a shower of gravel gravelleth
their enemy; but loud as was the war-cry of their
tiny voices, above it rose the booming thunder of the
"Parson's Clerk's" grand double-barrelled gun,&mdash;and
woeful was the effect thereof!!! The shot or the
wadding,&mdash;the manuscript sayeth not which&mdash;had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
entered,&mdash;<i>not</i> the brains, nor, even, the hats of the
juvenile assailants,&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;the church windows!
Away scampered the youngsters,&mdash;every mother's
son feeling whether his head was off or on,&mdash;and
yelling, till every cottage door in the neighbourhood
was thrown open, and lights were brought out in
alarm! Down tumbled the old coloured glass from
the ancient mullions, rattling on the tomb-stones
beneath, and sounding like curses on sacrilege in the
ears of the affrighted hero of the gun and the hayfork!
His weapon dropped,&mdash;for he was panic-struck!
The churchwardens brought a bill against
him for the repair of the church-windows: he refused
to pay: was brought before the Lincoln county magistrates
for recovery; and the hero of the hayfork
had to "fork out" seven shillings and sixpence for
his freak! The Stow rustics grinned from ear to ear,
nodded approbation of the sentence, and spread mirth
and fun when they reached home with the news;
but the reverend successor of the ancient episcopal
potencies was sorely grieved at heart when he heard
of this repetition of defeat for his chosen and chop-fallen
ejaculator of amens.</p>

<p>As for the grand Perpetual Curate himself, his
personal troubles and griefs, and the uninterrupted
continuation thereof, would require volumes for full
narration. Suffice it to say, ere we bring this exalted
record to an end, that, in the profundity of his
wisdom, he resorted to multitudinous devices of apos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>tolical
character, after the defeats at law that have
been heretofore noted. During ten successive Sundays
he resorted to a most novel course of Christianity,
closing the service after merely reading a few
of the "Sentences,"&mdash;or, in addition, a few words of
the "Absolution,"&mdash;and then, leaving his flock to find
their way to heaven as they might. The legitimate
"Parish Clerk" would come into his desk pretty
early; then would come in the "Parson's Clerk;"
and, lastly, the parson would walk into his desk, and
commence reading after the following unique method:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When the wicked man turneth away from his
wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that
which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.&mdash;&mdash;William
Middleton! I charge you to come out
of that seat, and let the clerk come in peaceably and
quietly!"</p>

<p>The poor "Parish Clerk," meanwhile, would make
no answer; but full meekly, and in the spirit of his
vocation, would hold his peace. Again the parson
would proceed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dearly beloved brethren, the Scripture moveth
us in sundry places to&mdash;&mdash;William Middleton! if
you do not come out of that seat, and cease interrupting
me in my duty, I shall conclude the service!"</p>

<p>And then would he close the book,&mdash;the poor
"Parish Clerk" answering not a word,&mdash;and,
walking to the communion-table, give a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
parish alms-loaves to such as he chose to call&mdash;usually
<i>his own</i> clerk, for one,&mdash;and then,&mdash;and
then,&mdash;in the spirit of Jewel and Latimer, and the
rest of the tireless and devoted exemplars of his religion,
would he quit the consecrated edifice, and leave
the congregation to finish by themselves,&mdash;or disperse,
which of course they preferred to do, after
witnessing these apostolical exhibitions. One more
relation of the subtle and profound devices of the
immortal and Perpetual Curate, ere we come to an
end.</p>

<p>Vexed, teased, troubled, and circumvented, as he
was, it came to pass that, in the plenitude of his
mortified and yet haughty reflections, the successor
of purple prelates bethought him that it was not
seemly for the rebellious herdsmen, ploughmen, and
other rustics of low degree, wherewith he was surrounded,
to walk daily over the "consecrated
ground" of the churchyard, in the ancient footpath.
The more he thought of it the more he shuddered at
it; that a number of rude rebels, with their heretical
and sacrilegious feet, should tread daily on
ground which had been "consecrated" in the hallowed
mists of dateless antiquity, by mitred magnates,
before whose uplifted crosier kings had lowered
their sceptres, and mailed barons trembled and turned
pale. It was not to be permitted: the magnanimous
Perpetual Curate resolved to root out such impious
sacrilege from the face of the earth; and immedi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>ately
fastened up the gates of the said ancient footpath
with strong locks and chains; yea, planted
goodly young trees in the line of road hitherto
trodden by unworthy and rebellious rustics. Nay,
more, conceiving that even the remembrance of every
grandmother and great-grandfather of such a stiff-necked
generation should be obliterated, his high-minded
Reverence gave order that all the hillocks
over the graves should be laid low, and the whole
churchyard be levelled!</p>

<p>But now the grand priest had reached a climax, in
the judgment of his parishioners; and now arose the
mighty wrath of the people,&mdash;that barrier which
hath so often stood before proud priests,&mdash;yea, and
will so stand again,&mdash;seeming to bear on its front,
"Thus far shall ye go, and no further, and here shall
your proud wills be stayed!" A parishioner, whose
purse was lined with a store of guineas to back his
resolution, avowed that the Perpetual Curate, if he
caused to be touched a single clod that covered the
ashes of his, the parishioner's, forefathers, should have
his clerical cup sweetened with all the sugar that
could be purchased for him in a court of law; and,
lo! the successor of the prelates of Sidnacester rescinded
his "order" for levelling the quiet graves of
the dead!</p>

<p>Nor long did the other late devices of his canonical
wisdom stand. The urchins of the parish contrived
to slip slily over the churchyard wall, and to break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
down the newly-planted trees; and, at length, one
parishioner, having conversed with Sir John Barleycorn
at Gainsborough market, and being strongly
advised by that notable counsellor of courage to set
the proud parson at nought, and "break his bonds
asunder," rushed to the churchyard gates, as soon as
he arrived at his native village, and smiting at locks
and chains, as if he had been Samson before Gaza,
burst his way valiantly through,&mdash;and, thereafter,
did the sacrilegious feet of every rebel rustic again
press the path of their forefathers, without let or
impediment! Such are the sovereign achievements
of the magisterial "people," when engaged in the
assertion of their time-hallowed "rights!" What
are the acts of emperors compared therewith?</p>

<p>And now come we to the final "action" in this
concaten<i>ation</i> of litig<i>ation</i>, one that gave constern<i>ation</i>
to the poor "parish clerk," be it understood. We
have spoken of the "actions" at the first Kirton
Sessions; namely, the Perpetual Curate <i>versus</i> the
Female Ambuscaders, and the Perpetual Curate
<i>versus</i> the Cudgellers in the dark: then spoke we of
the "action" at the next sessions, Clerk Spurr, the
Parson's Clerk, <i>v.</i> Clerk William Middleton, the son
of Clerk Gervase, the Parish Clerk: then of the <i>petit</i>
"action" before the Gainsborough Justices&mdash;Ellis
<i>v.</i> Skill: then of the greater "action" at assize&mdash;Skill
<i>v.</i> Ellis: then of the "action" before the
Lincoln magistrates for recovery of value for broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
church-windows&mdash;the Churchwardens of Stow <i>v.</i> the
Parson's Clerk: lastly, of the <i>threatened</i> action by
the parishioner of the long purse, which the Perpetual
Curate avoided by rescinding his presumptuous
"order" for levelling the graves:&mdash;but now come
we to the final "action"&mdash;the action of actions:
that to which all the rest formed but a petty preface:
that wherein the Perpetual Curate departing from all
by-ways of attack, undisguisedly assumed a position
of legal and spiritual antagonism against the foe
whom he esteemed as the chief author of his ills, the
disturber of his projected schemes, that would, so
many months before, have issued in subjugating the
rebels, and consuming heresy in his parish,&mdash;against
the old, hereditary, gentle, moral, upright parish
clerk, Clerk William Middleton, the son of Clerk
Gervase.</p>

<p>And <i>where</i> was the action commenced?&mdash;Before
the county magistrates,&mdash;or at sessions,&mdash;or at
assize? Pooh! nonsense!&mdash;that was not the way
to finish Middleton's business as the parson intended
to finish it. Where then? In the Queen's Bench,
or the Common Pleas, or the Exchequer? No.
What then, in the Vice Chancellor's Court, or the
Court of Chancery itself? Not one of 'em, sir; but
in a more awful court than any of 'em, or all of 'em
put together: in the <span class="smcap">Spiritual Court</span>, sir!</p>

<p>What aged dame in Lindsey had not heard of the
Spiritual Court? Why the mere sound of the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
served to fill her with mysterious awe, and to call up
in her memory all the fireside stories of her grandmothers:
how such awful "penances" were inflicted
by this court, on erring females, in <i>their</i> days,&mdash;when
the dread power of the priesthood was displayed in
punishing the subjects of that natural frailty called
"scandal," by compelling them to walk up the
church aisle covered with a white sheet, and bearing
a wax taper in their hand! With such associations
derived from his grandmother, only conceive how
awfully queer poor, moral, gentle, religious, upright
Clerk William felt when he received the mysterious
"writ," issued against him by this mysterious court.
"Schollard," as he was, it was so strange a thing to
look upon, that he instantly sent for the parish schoolmaster,
who, with spectacles on nose, and frequent
spelling and some mispelling, read aloud&mdash;to a house
full of consternated neighbours,&mdash;Clerk William
turning pale as he heard the beginning,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">In the Name of God, Amen!</span></p>

<p>"We, John Haggard, Doctor in Civil and Canon
Law, Vicar-General in spirituals of the Right
Reverend Father in God, John, by Divine Permission,
Lord Bishop of Lincoln, and official Principal
of the Episcopal and Consistorial Court of Lincoln,
lawfully constituted,&mdash;to you William Middleton, of
the parish of Stow, &amp;c. &amp;c., touching and concerning
your soul's health, and the lawful correction and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
reformation of your manners and excesses, and more
especially for profaning the parish church of Stow
aforesaid, by brawling, quarrelling, or chiding in the
said parish church during the celebration of divine
service therein by the Rev. &mdash;&mdash;, perpetual curate,
&amp;c. &amp;c., and also for contumacious behaviour, and
refusing to obey the lawful commands of the said
----," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>And then followed a pompous quotation from a
statute of Edward the Sixth, showing that a clergyman
had power to prohibit a contumacious member
of his flock <i>ab ingressu ecclesiæ</i>,&mdash;that is to say,
from entering the church: in other words, to excommunicate
him! Furthermore, an act of the 53d
George III. was quoted, declaring that "Persons
who may be pronounced or declared to be excommunicate
by any ecclesiastical court <i>in definitive sentences</i>,
or <i>in interlocutory decrees</i>, having the force and effect
of definitive sentences, as spiritual censures for offences
of ecclesiastical cognisance, shall incur imprisonment
not exceeding six months, as the court
pronouncing or decreeing such person excommunicate
shall direct."</p>

<p>That was a sore shake for poor Clerk William!
Excommunicated! Why, the thought of such a fate
to one who had been brought up in a veneration of
the church, whose father was a clerk, and thought
himself as fully consecrated as a bishop!&mdash;it was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
joke to such a one to hear there was a chance of his
being excommunicated. Yet he would not "give it
up!" No, that he wouldn't: his father had said,
"Nobody could turn the parish clerk out of his office
so long as he had morality on his side: his office was
his freehold:" so his father, Clerk Gervase, of pious
memory, had said; and he, Clerk William, would
abide by it. So he took the desk on the following
Sunday, and kept up the war as usual. Yet he often
pondered on "definitive sentences" and "interlocutory
decrees,"&mdash;when he had learnt the words by
heart,&mdash;wondering what kind of awful things they
were.</p>

<p>The effect of issuing this writ, however, so completely
astounded the parishioners that they thenceforth
only whispered where they had shouted, and
were silent where they had whispered, in all matters
relating to the parson: true, whenever a paper for
convening any particular parochial meeting was attached
to the church door, bearing the usual signature
of &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, Incumbent Minister, some wag
would be sure to scratch out one of the words, so as
to make it read "Incumbrance" Minister, instead:
but beyond that there was, now, no further daring.</p>

<p>And, at last, the summons came, and no less than
a score of witnesses were taken to the Consistory in
Lincoln Cathedral, to be sworn that they would give
evidence on the case. And week by week&mdash;week
by week&mdash;the prosing "examinations" were pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>ceeded
with, on a certain day of the week, until <i>a
thousand folios</i> of "examination" were counted;
and when a parishioner asked how much he must pay
for a copy of the depositions for Clerk William, the
reckoning was made by the "registrar" of the
court, at the usual sum per folio&mdash;and he was told
it would merely be such a trifle as <i>five-and-twenty
pounds</i>! And then the calculations, and the wonders,
and wishes that were expressed, night by night, and
day by day, in every cottage at Stow,&mdash;nay, in all
the villages round, and the wagers that were laid in
every village ale-house on a Saturday night, what
would be the cost of the whole trial, and how long
Clerk William would be imprisoned, and <i>where</i> they
would imprison him,&mdash;for nobody was so slow of
heart or understanding, as not to know beforehand
that the "Vicar-General in Spirituals" would give
judgment <i>against</i> the poor "parish clerk," as a
matter of course, whenever the trial should come to
an end.</p>

<p>And <i>did</i> the trial ever come to an end? and <i>was</i>
Clerk William Middleton, the son of Clerk Gervase,
really excommunicated? "By no manner of means,
sir," as the pompous fellow says in the play: the
grand suit, after causing so tremendous a quassation,
and all that, of a considerable quarter of Lindsey, was&mdash;given
up! Yes, it was: and more than that, the
true "parish clerk," Clerk William, was reinstated,
fully and entirely, in his rightful office. Ay to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
day,&mdash;unless our information misleads us,&mdash;he exercises
the same without losing an inch of his height,
or a fragment of his independent spirit; for it is but a
few months bygone since he showed it. The grand
Perpetual Curate, according to his wont, took upon
him to reprehend, at the very grave-side, a Wesleyan,
whose child, then being interred, had been baptized
by a Wesleyan preacher: Clerk William, right
bluntly, told the priest that the Wesleyan had a right
to please himself!  "Why, as for you, you will say
or do any thing," retorted the priest, "if they'll pay
you for it!"&mdash;"And would you be standing there in
that gown, with that book in your hand, unless <i>you</i>
were paid for it?" asked and answered Clerk William.
The grand Perpetual Curate bit his lip, and walked
away!</p>

<p>Reader, we have been relating <i>facts</i>: perhaps, in
adopting the style of half-rhodomontade, we have not
displayed very good taste; but the narrative itself
contains uncontradictable <i>facts</i>. And these did not
occur in a district disturbed by chartism, nor revolutionised
by radicalism, or anti-corn-law agitation;
but in the old-fashioned, rural centre of Lindsey: it
is even there where the "spiritual court" shrinks
from employing the foolery of its own worn-out
terrors; and where the peasant adventures to beard
the priest! Are not these "Signs of the Times?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>DAME DEBORAH THRUMPKINSON,</h2>

<p class="center">AND
HER ORPHAN APPRENTICE, JOE.</p>


<p>Joe's story opens in that unclassical region, the Isle
of Axholme,&mdash;a section of Lincolnshire divided from
the main body of the county by the broad and far
extending stream of the Trent. Insular situations
are invariably held to give some peculiarity of manners
to their inhabitants; and the Axholmians, or
"Men of the Isle," have always been reckoned to be
an odd sort of, plain kind of people, by the other inhabitants
of Lindsey, the great northern division of
the shire, of which the Isle is accounted a part. This
was more emphatically true of them seventy years
ago; and the face of the country was, at that time,
much in keeping with the unpolished character of the
Axholmian people. A journey through the Isle, in
the autumnal and winter months especially, would
then have been studiously avoided by a traveller
acquainted with its excessively bad roads, rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
insufferably disagreeable by the stench of the sodden
"line" or flax, with which the broad ditches on each
side of the rural ways were filled. Low, thatched
abodes, built of "stud and mud,"&mdash;or wood and
clay, were the prevailing description of human dwellings
scattered over the land; and swine were the
animals most commonly kept and fattened by the
farmers and peasantry.</p>

<p>The two considerable villages of Owston and Crowle
(pronounced <i>Crool</i> by the euphonious Axholmians),
together with the town of Epworth, the modern
capital of the Isle, were the only localities in Axholme
to which improvements, common in the rest of
the shire, had then penetrated. Haxey, the ancient
capital of the district, meanwhile, remained unvisited
by the spirit of modern change, and drew its only
distinction from the historic associations connected
with its decay. In remote times, and under its
Saxon appellation of "Axel," the town had been
fortified with a castle of the Mowbrays, to a chief of
which chivalrous race the greater part of "the Isle
of Axelholm" was given as a manor, by the Norman
conqueror. And, amid the straggling and irregular
assemblage of buildings which now form the village,
an intelligent visitor would discover indubitable evidence
of the former importance of the place. Its
large church, displaying the rich architecture prevalent
during the wars of the Roses, and supporting a
lofty tower resonant at stated hours with chimes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
loud and pleasing music, looks from an eminence,
almost in cathedral state, over the greater extent of
the Isle; and a few ample and curiously built houses
of some centuries old,&mdash;affording a striking contrast
to the paltry erections of the day,&mdash;denote the ancient
denizens of Haxey to have been the principal
possessors of comparative wealth, and, it may be added,
of the soil in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>On a fine summer's evening, at the door of one of
these large antiquated houses, sat Dame Deborah
Thrumpkinson, the aged widow of Barachiah Thrumpkinson,
cordwainer, deceased. Her husband, who had
been long dead, was a thrifty man at his trade, and
had, by habits of strict industry and parsimony,&mdash;holpen
therein by the like disposition of his beloved
Deborah,&mdash;contrived to store a good corner of his
double-locked oaken chest with spade-ace guineas.
Deborah had acquired sufficient skill in the "art and
mystery" of her husband's employment to be able
to carry on his trade after his death; and, with the
assistance of two stout apprentices, and as many
journeymen, was, at the season in which our narrative
begins, conducting the best business in that
line within a circuit of several miles.</p>

<p>We have hinted that Dame Deborah began to be
stricken in years: nevertheless, the labours of "the
gentle craft" gave little fatigue to her elastic mind
and strong sinewy frame; and as she sat in the old-fashioned
oaken chair, enjoying rest, and inhaling the
soft breeze, after a day of healthful toil, she neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
stooped through infirmity, nor experienced dimness
of vision, though sixty winters had gone over her
head. The short pipe in her mouth proved that
she had discovered an effectual, though unfeminine,
solace for a weary frame; and although, through the
flitting volumes of smoke, you saw that their frequent
visitings had left on the dame's cheek a deeper shade
than years only would have imprinted there,&mdash;yet,
a nearer gaze would have convinced you that, in
youth, no contemptible degree of comeliness had been
commingled with her strength. With the calmness
derived from experienced age, and from a consciousness
of honest independence,&mdash;thus, then, sat the
grave Deborah, receiving, now and then, a mark of
respect from the slow, worn labourers of either sex,
as they passed homeward, with fork or rake on
shoulder, from the hay-field.</p>

<p>The dame had just knocked the ashes out of the
head of her pipe, and was about to retire within her
dwelling for the night, when her attention was strongly
attracted by the conversation of a group which was
suddenly formed but a few yards from her threshold.
A pale, melancholy-looking woman, with a very little
boy clinging to her blue linen apron, was met by
a master chimney-sweep, followed by a couple of
wretched-looking urchins bowed beneath enormous
bags of soot.</p>

<p>"Well, mistress," said the man, in a voice so harsh
that it grated sorely on the ears of Dame Deborah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
who would have been offended with the words of the
speaker, even if they had been uttered in the softest
accents, "you may as well take the fasten-penny I
offered you the other day, and let me have this lad
o' yours."</p>

<p>The child clung more closely to his mother, and
looked imploringly and pitifully in her face.</p>

<p>"Nay, I think I mustn't," replied the pale-looking
woman, in a faint and somewhat irresolute tone,
catching the wistful glance of her child, and then
bending her eyes sorrowfully on the ground.</p>

<p>"Why, a golden guinea'll do thee some service,"
resumed the sweep; "and I'll warrant me, I'll take
care o' thy little lad. He shall get plenty to eat and
drink,&mdash;and I reckon he doesn't get overmuch of
ayther with thee."</p>

<p>"I get as much as my mammy gets," said the child,
adventuring to speak, but looking greatly affrighted.</p>

<p>"Why, thou art a tight little rogue," said the
chimney sweep, smiling grimly through his soot,
"and could run briskly up a chimney, I lay a wager.&mdash;Come,
give us thy hand, and say thou wilt go
with us."</p>

<p>The man's attempt at coaxing had a repulsive
effect on the child, for he drew back, and trembled
lest he should be laid hold of.</p>

<p>"Come, I'll make it two guineas," resumed the
sweep, again addressing the mother; "and what
canst thou do with him, now his father is dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>&mdash;as
thou saidst when I met thee at Wroot, the other
day? Thou wilt be obliged to throw thyself on some
parish, soon,&mdash;for they'll never suffer thee to go
sorning about in this way; and if thou art once in
the workhouse, depend on't th' overseers will soon
'prentice the poor little fellow to somebody that may
prove a hard master to him, mayhap. Better take
my offer, and let him be sure of kind usage."</p>

<p>The mother was silent and motionless, and tears
began to fall fast, while the sense of her present destitution
and fears for the impending future struggled like
strong wrestlers, with natural affection:&mdash;a fearful
antagonism within, of which none but Adversity's
children can conceive the reality of the portraiture.</p>

<p>"Nay, prythee, do not fret," said the man, with
affected pity; and then taking out his begrimed
hempen purse under the confident expectation that he
was about to gain his point at once from the heart-broken
weakness of a woman, added, "Come, come,
here's that that will get thee a new gown, and, maybe,
put thee in the way of getting on in the world
besides."</p>

<p>The woman did not put forth her hand to take the
proffered price for her child, for her mind was now
too deeply distracted to understand the sweep's
meaning; or, if she understood him, her frame was
now too weak with grief to permit her making any
answer.</p>

<p>"Oh, mammy, mammy!&mdash;do not let the grimy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
man take me away!" exclaimed the child, bursting
into violent weeping, and pulling forcibly at his
mother's apron.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with your bairn, good woman?"
cried the benevolent old Dame Deborah at
this moment,&mdash;for she had heard too much to be
longer a listener, merely;&mdash;and the Axholmians were
not versed in those refinements of modern society
which define a neighbourly and humane interposition
to be an act of unmannerly officiousness.</p>

<p>"Mammy, mammy!&mdash;good old woman speaks
you," said the eager child, striving to arouse his
mother's attention, and to call off her mind from the
intense conflict which seemed to have paralysed her
consciousness.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," observed the sweep, "Dame Thrumpkinson
is a thrifty, sensible body: let us put it, now,
to her, as a reasonable matter, and see if she does
not say I speak fair."</p>

<p>The group drew near the dame's door, and the
man recounted the terms of his proposal with a self-complacent
emphasis which indicated that he believed
the dame, being a well-reputed tradeswoman,
would assent at once to the advisableness of his
scheme, and assist him in its immediate accomplishment.</p>

<p>"Now, what d'ye think, dame?" he said in conclusion;
"d'ye not think that I speak fair?"</p>

<p>"Think!" answered the aged woman, fixing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
keen grey eyes upon the trafficker with an expression
which withered his hopes in a moment;&mdash;"think!&mdash;why
I think it would be a sinful shame to soil that
bairn's pratty face wi' soot; and I think, beside, that
thou hast so little of a man in thee, to wring a
widowed-woman's heart by tempting her to barter
the body and soul of her own bairn for gold, that if
I were twenty years younger, I would shake thy
liver in thee for what thou hast said to her."</p>

<p>The man's countenance fell, and he looked, for a
moment, as if about to return an answer of abuse;
but the dame kept her keen eye bent unblenchingly
upon him;&mdash;and it seemed as if his courage failed,
for he put up the guineas hastily into his purse, and
turned from the spot, without daring to attempt an
answer, followed by the two diminutive slaves whose
hard lot it was to call him "Master."</p>

<p>"Ah, poor woman!" exclaimed Dame Deborah
to the weeping and speechless mother;&mdash;"what a
sorry sight it would have been to see you take yon
hard-hearted rascal's money, while this poor faytherless
innocent trudged away with a bag o' soot on his
feeble back! No, no, it isn't come to that, nayther,"
she continued, vacating her arm-chair, and gently
forcing the distressed woman into it; "sit thee
down, poor heart! the bairn shall not want a friend,
if aught should ail thee. I'll take care of him myself,
if God Almighty should take thee away as well
as his poor fayther."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"God bless you, dame!" sobbed the cheered
mother, clasping her hands, and bursting anew into
tears, which were now tears of joy.</p>

<p>"God bless good old woman!" shouted the little
fellow, with the real heaven of guileless childhood in
his face.</p>

<p>"My poor child may soon need your goodness,
kind dame," rejoined the melancholy mother, turning
very deadly pale,&mdash;"for I feel I am not long
for this world: my strength is nearly gone."</p>

<p>"Well, well, poor heart, cheer up!" said the
dame, in a tone of sincere condolence:&mdash;"remember,
that there is One above, who hath said, He will be "a
husband to the widow, and a"&mdash;&mdash;but I'll fetch thee
and thy pratty bairn a bite o' bread and cheese, and a
horn o' mead.&mdash;Lord bless me! how white the poor
creature is turning! God Almighty save her soul!
she's going!"</p>

<p>The kind old woman hastened to support the sinking
head of the dying stranger, and the child clung,
convulsively, to the cold and helpless hand of his
mother,&mdash;and uttered his wailing agony. All was
soon over,&mdash;for the poor wanderer died almost instantaneously
in Dame Deborah's arm-chair.</p>

<p>Reader, if thou hast a heart to love thy mother,
I need not attempt to describe to thee how deep was
the grief and horror felt by the orphan as he gazed
upon his dead mother's face. And if thou hast not
such a heart, I will not give thee an occasion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
slight a feeling so holy as a child's absorbed love for
its loving mother.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, that after three days of almost
unmitigated grief, the child, led by Dame Deborah,
followed his mother's corpse, sobbing, to the grave;
but the aged hand that conducted him to witness the
laying of his heart-broken parent in her last resting-place
led him back to a comfortable home. The
sudden and striking circumstances of his mother's
death saddened the orphan's spirits for some time; but
he soon recovered the natural gaiety of childhood,
notwithstanding his transference from the care of an
affectionate and over-indulgent mother, to that of a
guardian of advanced age and grave manners.</p>

<p>Deborah Thrumpkinson in vain inquired after the
orphan's full name. He only knew that he had been
called "Joe." She guessed that he must be about
four years old; and, fearful that a ceremony which
she conceived to be an indispensable preparative for
his eternal salvation might have been neglected, she
took him to the font of the parish church, and had
him baptized "Joseph&mdash;in a Christian way," as she
termed it: the good dame, herself, becoming surety
for the child's fulfilment of the vows thus taken upon
himself by proxy.</p>

<p>Joe's godmother and protectress taught him to
read. And no benefit she conferred upon him in
after-life was more thankfully remembered by him
than this, her humane and patient initiation of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
infantile understanding into the mystery of the
alphabet, and the formation of syllables. Here her
labour ended, for her science extended little further;
but a Bible with the Apocrypha, ornamented with
plates,&mdash;a valued family possession of the Thrumpkinsons,&mdash;was
within his reach, and, at any hour of
Sunday,&mdash;and sometimes on other days of the week
when he had washed his hands very clean,&mdash;he was
privileged with the growing pleasure of turning over
the pages of the folio of wonders ever new.</p>

<p>The good old Dame was not disposed to mar her
act of genuine charity,&mdash;the adoption of an orphan,&mdash;by
imprisoning his young limbs too early in the
bonds of labour. She did not place him on the
humble <i>stall</i> to bend over the <i>last</i>, till she supposed
he had reached the age of fourteen. The ten preceding
years of his orphanage passed away in a course
of happy quietude. The staid age of his venerated
protectress forbade any outbreaks of juvenile buoyancy
in her sedate presence; but in Joe's lonely
wanderings through the fields and lanes, as well as
in his silent readings of the pictured Scriptures, he
found pleasures which abundantly repaid the irksomeness
of occasional restraint. His simple heart danced
with joy at each return of the gladsome Spring, when
his beloved acquaintances, the wild flowers, shewed
their beautiful faces by brook and hedgerow; and he
became familiar with all their localities, and felt a
glowing and mysterious rapture in the renewed sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>vey
of their glorious tints and delicate pencillings,
long before he learnt their names.</p>

<p>The commencement of his apprenticeship was
marked by an event of no less importance than his
introduction to Toby Lackpenny,&mdash;the most learned
tailor in the Isle of Axholme,&mdash;and a personage of
such exalted merit, that we purpose to pluck a sprig
of "immortal amaranth," by making the world acquainted
with his separate history:&mdash;"but let that
pass." Toby,&mdash;from the rich immensity&mdash;for such
it seemed to Joe&mdash;of his "library,"&mdash;furnished the
young disciple of St. Crispin with two books which
completely fascinated him: they were&mdash;the immortal
fables of "The Pilgrim's Progress" and "Robinson
Crusoe,"&mdash;by the immortal toilers, John Bunyan
and Daniel Defoe. Joe was assured by his new
friend that Crusoe's adventures were no less veritable
true than wonderful,&mdash;while the "Pilgrim" had a
hidden and all-important meaning, which he must
endeavour to discover, and apply to his own spiritual
state as he went along.</p>

<p>During the season of his intense and enamoured
pursuit of these absorbing studies, an incident occurred
which produced some uneasiness both to
teacher and disciple. Joe was seated, one evening,
on a stool at the tailor's door, fervently engaged in
his usual recreation,&mdash;the tailor meanwhile plying
his needle,&mdash;when the clergyman of the village passing
by, and observing the boy's studious deportment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
as something unusual, stepped towards him, and desired
to know what he was so intent upon. Joe
naturally felt some diffidence in returning an answer,
and turned towards his friend on the shop-board with
a glance that was meant to entreat his kind offices in
the formation of a reply. But the tailor, to Joe's
utter confusion, hung down his head doggedly, and
struck his needle into a nether garment that lay upon
his knees, with singular vehemence. In default of
this expected help, Joe gave his two precious volumes,
silently and resignedly, into the hands of the vicar,&mdash;a
reverend gentleman held in deserved respect by his
humble flock for the rigid purity of his morals, but
of small skill in the waywardness of the human mind.</p>

<p>After a very few minutes' examination of the
books, the spiritual overseer crimsoned with apparent
displeasure, shook his head very expressively at the
boy, and returning the volumes into his hands, assured
him he was very sorry to see him so ill employed,&mdash;"for
one of the books," he said, "contained only a
foolish tale,&mdash;and the other was as whimsical a dream
as ever ran through the brains of a fanatic." So saying,
the well-intentioned, but ill-informed, teacher
turned away,&mdash;leaving the boy to his own reflections,
and the hot criticism of the tailor on what they
had just heard from the village parson. These by
no means led Joe into a coincidence with the vicar's
way of thinking; and, whenever opportunity served,
he was sure, as before, to be wandering, ideally, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the romantic and intrepid adventurer on the desert
island, or to be found absorbed in the effort to penetrate
the spiritual mysteries he had been directed to
discover in the remaining volume whose enchanting
imagery had captivated his young understanding.
"A foolish tale,"&mdash;he could not conceive the narrative
of the shipwrecked and eremite mariner to be:
it was too full of sober earnestness, he thought, to be
fantastic: it created before him a verisimilitude in
which he himself lived all the wild yet truthful adventures
of the cast-a-way seaman over again. And
if he had not been told that the story of the Pilgrim
was a parable, his simple and eager phantasy would
have, primarily, set it down for a literal truth,&mdash;however
after-reflection might have qualified his first
conclusion.</p>

<p>But the accident of his evening's occupation having
been scrutinised by the clergyman had not yet expended
its influence on Joe's thoughts and feelings.
On the first ensuing visit made by Dame Deborah to
pay her tithes, she was solemnly admonished to forbid
her godson's unprofitable studies, and to interdict his
future association with the tailor. The good dame's
reverence for her spiritual guide inclined her, at
once, to yield obedience to his recommendation;
more especially as she had for some time noted that
the boy did not, as formerly, eagerly resort, at every
leisure opportunity, to the old family Bible.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on her return home, she sharply re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>proved
him for his neglect of the sacred book, and insisted
that he should discontinue his communings at
the tailor's cottage, and read no more of his books.
Joe returned not a word in answer to the reproof of
his aged mistress, for mingled gratitude, under a sense
of her tender kindness, and reverence for her authority,
rendered him incapable of disobeying her orders. He
returned, dutifully, to the perusal of his first book;
but though the rich variety of its histories, and the
sublime interest of its matchless poetry, did not fail
to keep alive his attention while he bent over its
pages, yet, in the long hours of daily labour, his
desire strongly thirsted for the more exciting intellectual
draught of which he had lately partaken, and
a dreary and monotonous feeling of weariness consumed
his spirit. Dame Deborah little knew the
evil she was doing when she bereaved her foster-child
of his innocent pleasures. In the lapse of a few
weeks she became sensible that it was not always
wise to pursue the counsel even of the village parson
too strictly.</p>

<p>Among the visiters to the dame's domicile, there
had long been some who professed the tenets of
Wesley,&mdash;the great heresiarch who drew his first
breath in the Isle of Axholme. Of the peculiar
doctrines set forth by this celebrated religious
teacher, Joe, like Deborah herself, knew nought, save
that the parson said they were "heresies." The
sturdy intelligence of Dame Deborah led her to turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
a deaf ear to all innovations in religion. She had
been bred a strict church-woman, and never conceived
the slightest idea of the fallibility of the
orthodox and established Protestant faith. Her apprentices
were not permitted to attend meeting or
conventicle; and she steadfastly repelled and discouraged
all attempts, on the part of her visiters, to
introduce religious novelties in their daily gossip. But
the restlessness and disquietude of his mind, now its
faculties were once more without a fixed object of
attachment, impelled Joe to discard, imperceptibly
at first, the rules on religious matters, which had
been tacitly observed by every member of the
dame's household ever since he had entered it. With
those who manifested a disposition to enlarge on the
merits of the new religious system, he entered
eagerly into discussion; and the result was, a determination
to pay a secret attendance on one of the
meetings of the sect, and thus form a judgment for
himself.</p>

<p>A preacher of considerable rhetorical powers occupied
the meeting-house pulpit, during his first
stolen visits; and the skill with which passages from
the book which had been his first source of instruction
were quoted and applied, rivetted his attention and
inflamed his fancy. The speaker gave illustrations
of some of the patriarchal histories, and founded on
them, and upon the sacrifices under the Mosaic law,
such hypotheses as were exactly calculated to awe, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
yet to lead captive, Joe's active imagination. To
tell, in one sentence, the history of numberless hours
of mental revolution, Joe brooded over these theories
and their consequences while engaged at his daily
labour, and repeated his secret visits to the meeting-house,
until his young and earnest mind was filled
with the one pervading idea that the only true happiness
for the human soul was to be found in some
sudden and ecstatic change to be received by what
his new teachers called "an act of faith in the atonement."</p>

<p>From the period in which this conviction took
entire hold of his judgment, the alteration in Joe's
conduct was so decided as to become serious cause of
alarm, even to the firm common-sense of Dame
Deborah. He spurned the thought of any longer
concealing his attendance at the sectarian meeting-house;
and at every brief cessation from labour, as
well as at prolonged hours in the night, and early in
the morning, he was overheard in a weeping agony
of prayer. His humble bed-room, an out-house, or
the corner of a field, served the young devotee alike,
for a place of "spiritual wrestling;" and whoever
gave him an opportunity was sure to receive from
Joe an earnest warning to "flee from the wrath to
come!" Days,&mdash;weeks rolled on,&mdash;and the ardour
of the lad's enthusiasm was approaching its meridian,&mdash;for
he had given up himself so completely to its
power, that not only did he consume the night more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
fully in prolonged acts of ascetic and almost convulsive
devotion,&mdash;but his mind was so entirely wrapt
up in the effort to "pray without ceasing,"&mdash;that he
was scarcely conscious of what passed in the dame's
cottage during the hours of work.</p>

<p>The visit of a "Revivalist" to the new religious
community at Haxey thus found Joe fully prepared
to hail the event as one fraught with unspeakable
benefits. The narrow meeting-house was crammed
with villagers attracted by the loud and unusual
noises, and affected by the agonised looks and gestures,
of their neighbours. Many of these stray visiters,
in the language of the initiated, "came to scoff,
but remained to pray." The "Revivalist" crept from
form to form,&mdash;for the humble meeting-house was
unhonoured with a pew,&mdash;urging the weeping and
kneeling penitents to "press into mercy;" and pouring
forth successive petitions for their salvation until
the perspiration dropped from his brows like rain.</p>

<p>Joe was too intensely absorbed in the burning desire
to obtain the immediate purification of his nature
to be able to reflect, for a moment, on the question,&mdash;whether,
in all this boisterous procedure, there
was not an appalling violation of every principle of
worship. And when the preacher approached the
form at which he was kneeling, the workings of
his spirit shook his whole frame with expectation.
The preacher, at length, addressed him:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"Believe, my young brother," said he, in a voice</span><br />
naturally musical, and rendered wonderfully influential
by enthusiasm,&mdash;"believe, for the pardon of your
sins!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I would believe in a moment, if I felt they
were pardoned!" cried Joe, in all the earnestness of
excitement.</p>

<p>"Nay, but you must believe first!" rejoined the
preacher; "only believe that your sins are pardoned,
and you will feel your burden gone!"</p>

<p>The boy's reason, for a moment, asserted its own
majesty, at the broaching of this wild doctrine; and
he returned an instant answer to the preacher which
would have confounded a less practised casuist.</p>

<p>"That would be pardoning myself," he said: "I
want the Lord to pardon me: if believing that my
sins were forgiven, while I feel they are not, would
produce a real pardon, I need never have asked the
Almighty to perform the work."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear young brother!" quickly replied
the preacher,&mdash;"I waited, as you have, no doubt, for
weeks and weeks, expecting some miracle to be performed
for me; but I found, at last, that there was
no other refuge but believing. You <i>must</i> believe:
<i>that</i> is your only way! All the direction that the
word gives you is, '<i>Believe</i>, and thou shalt be saved!'
You have nothing else to do but to believe; and the
moment you do believe&mdash;that moment you will be
happy! Try it!"&mdash;and, so saying, the "Revivalist"
hastened on to make proof of the efficacy of his wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
notional catholicon upon the comfortless spirit of
some less hesitating patient or penitent.</p>

<p>Joe's distress, when the preacher left him, became
greater than ever. He felt fearful, on the one hand,
of becoming a victim to self-deceit; and was horrified,
on the other, with the terrible dread of losing his soul
through the sin of unbelief. But the combat between
his imagination and his understanding was
one in which the former faculty had all the vantage-ground
of his youthful age and his tendency to the
marvellous,&mdash;and was immeasurably assisted by the
overwhelming energy of his desire. The attainment
of the new spiritual state had become his sole idea;
and his reason succumbed beneath the combined
strength of his wishes and the prurience of his
ideality.</p>

<p>"The preacher says he has <i>tried</i> believing, and it
has made him happy; therefore, I will try to believe,"
said Joe to himself,&mdash;becoming mentally desperate
with distracting fears.</p>

<p>He <i>did</i> try; and the experiment produced,&mdash;as it
could not fail to produce in such a mind, surrounded
with such excitements,&mdash;a thrilling and ecstatic feeling;
but yet, he doubted again, a few moments
after! Thus, his intellect, all undisciplined and untutored
as it had been, still revolted at the indignity
of becoming the dupe of its own trickery. But the
misery of doubt, and the pangs of spiritual condemnation,
were more insupportable than the effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to impose upon himself the delusive assurance that he
really possessed what he so ardently sought; and he,
therefore, rushed to another act of desperate credence:&mdash;"I
<i>will</i> believe! I <i>do</i> believe!" he wildly
cried, at the full pitch of his voice, while the din and
confusion of fifty persons praying aloud, at the same
time, rendered his enthusiasm unnoticeable. At
every new resurrection of his reason he thus drew
afresh on the exorcism of his ideality, and allayed
the troublous misgivings of the sterner faculty; so
that, by the time the meeting was concluded, his
reason had ceased to rebel,&mdash;and he went home, persuaded
that he had attained the "new birth."</p>

<p>For some days, Joe dwelt in a frame of greater
tranquillity than he had experienced since the commencement
of his religious "awakenings." But the
calm was a deceitful one; and was but the prelude
to a more terrific tempest than had ever yet raged in
the breast of the young victim to the ideal. Joe
heard descriptions from the pulpit of the sectaries, of
the unspeakable ecstasy of true believers; and reflected
that his own feelings bore scarcely any resemblance
to such highly-wrought pictures. Gradually,
he felt it utterly impossible to conceal from himself
the tormenting conviction that he had never received
that amazing change of nature which he had been
taught, so energetically and sanguinely, to expect as
the fruit of his "act of faith." Instead of the
"heavenly joy of assurance," which the preachers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
described,&mdash;Joe could not conceal from himself the
fact that his nearest approaches to inward joy and
calm,&mdash;fitful as they were,&mdash;resulted from the effort
to <i>assure himself</i>; and this seemed too strained a
mental state, he thought, to be termed "heavenly
joy of assurance." Then, again, he was conscious
that he had not the mental purity that he had heard
described as one of the certain marks of regeneration.
And this, soon, hurried him into a whirlpool of inward
distraction;&mdash;for, instead of attributing the irritability
and peevishness which now frequently agitated
him to their real source,&mdash;the exhaustion of his
nervous system by extreme asceticism,&mdash;the poor boy
set them down, in his helpless and pitiable ignorance,
to the inheritance of a nature that involved him,
still, in the awful sentence of divine wrath. The tortures
of disappointment thus augmented the distraction
of doubt; and, at length, Joe was unable to
quell his uneasiness for another moment by resorting
to the act of self-delusion recommended by the "Revivalist,"&mdash;and
called by him "the act of faith."
Worn out, and jaded, with his daily, hourly, and
almost momentary attempts to palm the fiction, anew,
upon his understanding, Joe gave up the practice
of "the act of faith" altogether, with a feeling of
weariness and disgust and self-degradation too bitter
for description!</p>

<p>The prostration of the youth's corporeal strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
accompanied this distressing mental conflict. Dame
Deborah began to watch the hectic flush on the cheek
of her beloved foster-child with an aching heart;
and, for the first time, entertained fears, that Time,
so far from curing him of his errors, would only serve
to mark his early grave. She would have interdicted
his future attendance on the meetings of his religious
associates; but the drooping state of his health deterred
her from crossing his will, lest she should
hasten the catastrophe which she began, in sadness
and sorrow, to anticipate.</p>

<p>The good old dame finally resolved to try the efficacy
of a change of scene and circumstances, as
means of aiding the youth's recovery. Joe had never
yet crossed the bounds of Haxey parish since he entered
it; but the Dame being in the habit of attending
the weekly market at Gainsborough, the nearest
trading town, she determined that he should become
a partner in her future journies. Her project was as
sensible as it was benevolent. The new excitements
created for the lad by these little expeditions could
not fail to produce an issue in some degree salutary
to his mind. And yet the relief he experienced
might have been but temporary, had not a medicine,&mdash;seemingly
hazardous,&mdash;but yet, signally well
adapted for his disordered mental condition,&mdash;been
opportunely disclosed from the womb of Circumstance,&mdash;the
great productive source of new thinkings, new
resolves, and new courses of action, which, in mockery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of ourselves, we so often attribute to our own "will"
and "intelligence."</p>

<p>Mounted on a stout grey mare, with his aged mistress
behind, on an old-fashioned pillion-seat, Joe set
forth on his first journey with emotions of natural
curiosity; and, in the course of his progress, began
to regain some degree of his constitutional cheerfulness.
Eight miles of country, beheld for the first
time, though its landscape was only of an ordinary
and monotonous character, presented a world of objects
for reflection to Joe's impressible spirit. The
season was an early spring; and albeit the young
equestrian felt some slight alarm when the animal
sunk, beneath the superincumbent weight of himself
and his companion, well-nigh up to the saddle-skirts,
in the miry sloughs that intervened between Haxey
and the Trent,&mdash;yet the view of the face of nature,
smilingly outspread around him, fully compensated,
he felt, for these occasional drawbacks on the pleasure
of the journey. The few verdant meads which
were scattered among the dull fallows looked as
lovely, Joe thought, as they could look in any other
part of England; while the cottages, in their array
of honeysuckles, were attired as blushingly and beautifully,
he thought, as if reared in the sunny climes
of the South.</p>

<p>Midway in the journey, Joe and his aged mistress
dismounted to cross the Trent,&mdash;and four more
miles brought them to Gainsborough. On arriving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
at the market-town, the good old dame, somewhat
to the lad's surprise, presented him with half-a-crown,&mdash;a
sum he had never, till then, possessed.
After a brief preface of prudence, she informed him
that he was at liberty to spend the next three hours in
looking at the rarities in the market, in walking about
the town, or in any mode that he thought would
most highly gratify his curiosity. Joe set forth, anticipating
sights which might afford a passing gratification;
but in the course of the first hour became
immovably attracted by a display of merchandise,
from which the rustic traffickers of the market, too
generally, turned away with indifference,&mdash;a spacious
stall of old books.</p>

<p>The image of a homely country lad, clad in a rustic
garb, and shod with heavy-laced boots, standing by
that old book-stall, presented a very uninteresting
spectacle to the market people at Gainsborough.
The butter-women brushed rudely past him, grumbling
at the awkwardness with which he obstructed
their crowded path; and the hucksters roughly
cursed him, half-overturning the absorbed youth in
their haste to forestall each other in cheapening the
produce of the village dairies. Yet Joe was wont
to refer to the hour during which he looked over the
tattered treasures of the travelling bookseller as the
most important in his whole life. He laid out the
first half-crown he had ever possessed in purchasing
the translated work of a French philosopher, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
knowing, for many months after, that the author of the
book bore an opprobious designation among theologians.
At successive periods of his after-history, Joe
attributed this occurrence to the operation of the inevitable
laws of necessity, to accident, to permissive
Providence: but, without entering into the labyrinth
of his progressive trains of thought, or solving the
question of the validity of any of his conclusions,&mdash;suffice
it to say, that the purchase of that book produced
a sequel of the most intense interest to the
young and undirected inquirer.</p>

<p>Joe had but just paid his half-crown into the
hand of the bookseller, and buttoned the volume in
the breast of his coat, when his ears were stricken by
the boisterous tones of a bawling pedlar. With remarkable
elongation of face, the man was proclaiming
the wondrous contents of a pamphlet that he held in
his hand, copies of which he was offering for sale,
"amazingly cheap," as he avowed, to the staring
by-standers. The stroller rapidly gleaned coppers
among the wonder-stricken butter-women, who forgot
their baskets in the serious interest awakened by
the pedlar's tale; and Joe could not refrain from
noting the comments which the simple people made
upon the story.</p>

<p>"Here is a true and faithful account," reiterated
the pedlar, with all his power of lungs, "of the awful
apparition of a young woman to her sweetheart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
three weeks after her death,&mdash;warning him, in the
most solemn manner, to forsake his evil ways, and
not to deceive others, as he had deceived her,&mdash;and
foretelling to him that he would die that day fortnight,&mdash;and
then vanishing in a flash of fire, leaving
a smell of brimstone behind her! And how the
young man took to his bed immediately after, and
died at the time his sweetheart had foretold,&mdash;making
a godly confession of his sins on his death-bed.
All which happened," concluded the pedlar,
with a look of solemn assurance that went at once to
the hearts of his unsuspecting audience,&mdash;"but one
month ago, in the county of Cornwall;&mdash;and here
are the names of ten creditable parishioners of the
place, who heard the young man's confession, and
have set their names as witnesses of the truth of the
circumstance, that it might be a warning to young
men to repent, and not to deceive their sweet-hearts,&mdash;and
all this you have for the small charge
of one penny!"</p>

<p>"The Lord ha' marcy on us, Moggy," cried a
young and blooming butter-woman to her elderly
neighbour, as they leant over the handles of their
baskets, aghast with wonder:&mdash;"what an awful
thing it must ha' been to see that young woman
come from the deead!"</p>

<p>"It must, indeed, Dolly," replied the older gossip,
shaking her head: "it's enough to mak one tremmle
to think on't! Some folks say that there's no sich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
thing as a ghooast,&mdash;but I'm sewer I wouldn't be
so wicked as to say so."</p>

<p>"And she vanished in a flash o' fire and brimstone,
did she, maister?" said Dolly to the pedlar, as she
tendered her penny.</p>

<p>"That she did, pretty maid!" quickly answered
the vender, with a look of roguish seriousness: "take
the book home, and let your sweetheart read it to
you, if you can't read it yourself; and you'll find that
what I have said is all true."</p>

<p>"I hope it is, maister, for they're solemn things
to joke about!" remarked a staid-looking matron,
who was taking out her spectacles to read the veracious
story.</p>

<p>"True as the Gospel!" exclaimed the ready
pedlar: "I was born and brought up in the parish,
and know every one of the creditable yeomen who
have signed the young man's confession."</p>

<p>"Yo may ha' been born there," interjected a Sheffield
huckster, with a satirical grin; "but it's many
a moile off!"</p>

<p>The pedlar strode rapidly away to a distant part
of the market.</p>

<p>"Why, you dooant doot what th' man says, do
you, Roger?" asked a fair Axholmian butter-maiden
of the huckster.</p>

<p>"Daht!" replied the Sheffielder, in his own dialect;
"I al'ays daht loies, mun! But come, lass!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
tak t'other hawp'ny a pahnd, and bring t' basket
along wi' thee!"</p>

<p>"Marcy on us!" exclaimed the butter-woman in
spectacles, as the rude huckster left the market;
"you Sheffield fellow'll hev to see a ghooast before
he believes there is one! What an alarming accoont
this is, to be sewer!"</p>

<p>"Would you be so kind," said Joe to the elderly
dame who uttered this latter exclamation, "as to let
me look at the account for a few minutes? I will
return it to you again, very soon."</p>

<p>"Why, yes,&mdash;I'll let you look at it," answered the
woman, scanning him from head to foot; "and I
hope you'll take a lesson from the book, and never
act so wickedly as this young man did."</p>

<p>It was not mere curiosity which prompted the lad
to ask the loan of the pedlar's tract. He felt certain
that he had glanced at a similar tale in a volume of
old pamphlets on the bookseller's stall, but a few
minutes before. After a short search, he found the
volume again, and comparing the stories, saw that
they were the same, to a letter, save that the copy
on the stall affirmed the apparition to have taken
place in Westmoreland, more than half-a-century
before. While his thoughts were all in a tumult at
this strange discovery, the bookseller, who was attentive
to the behaviour of his customers, stept up,
and addressed him in a whisper.</p>

<p>"You look surprised, young man," he said, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Joe gazed at the sinister expression in his countenance;
"but I knew it was all an old story, though
the fellow was making such a noise about it. Say
nothing about it, however,&mdash;for all trades must live,&mdash;and
most people would think one tale as good and
as true as the other!"</p>

<p>The bookseller was only just in time with his precept
of caution; for Joe's gathering indignation at
the pedlar's imposture would have impelled him, the
next moment, to break through his boyish bashfulness,
and proclaim his discovery aloud, in the ears of
the surrounding butter-women:&mdash;a proceeding which,
in lieu of thanks, would have, no doubt, drawn down
upon his head a storm of wrath from their disturbed
superstition. Feeling unspeakably confused with his
reflections, Joe now hastily returned the volume to its
place on the stall; and thanking the kind butter-woman
for her loan of the ghost-story, gave it carefully
into her hands. He then hasted away towards
the little inn where he was to meet Dame Deborah,
partly under an impression that his hours of liberty
were near their expiry,&mdash;but much more with the
persuasion that he would be able, as he went along,
being no longer surrounded with the market-din, to
disentangle the web of conflicting thought into which
the slight incidents just narrated had cast him.</p>

<p>The pedlar's falsehood and audacity,&mdash;and the
whispered caution of the bookseller, whom Joe felt
strongly inclined to characterise as an abettor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
imposture and knavery,&mdash;the credulity of the butter-women,&mdash;and
the gaping wonder manifested by the
listening crowd,&mdash;formed a mass of striking corroborations,&mdash;a
sort of powerful running commentary on
what he had hastily read in the volume he had just
purchased. The incidents in the little market, in fact,
opened to the lad's inexperienced mind a glimpse of
the melancholy truth that man and the multitude have
been prone to superstition in all ages, and have eagerly
received frauds which have been imposed upon them,
throughout all time, by the craft of interested and
organised parties; or, where these were wanting,
that man has forged deceptions for himself, through
the strength of his own wondering faculty. The end
to which these incipient reasonings would lead him
was not, and could not, then, be manifest to him; or
Joe, scarcely rid of his fanatical incubus, would have
revolted from them with horror. It was merely
the dawn of thoughts which were waiting to break
in upon his mind with all the power and effulgence
of new truth. But, whatever might be the tendency
of these commencing reasonings, the progress of them
was speedily arrested by the beginning of the journey
homewards.</p>

<p>Joe, with the good old dame behind him, rode as
far as the Trent ferry, at Stockwith, in company
with sundry rustic frequenters of the weekly market.
The gossip chiefly consisted of a recapitulation of the
prices of corn and flax, and poultry, and pigs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
butter,&mdash;until the re-introduction of the ghost-story,
at what time Joe and his foster-mother, with the
rest, were seated in the ferry-boat, and were recrossing
the Trent.</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;it's an awful accoont, Maister Gawky!"
exclaimed Diggory Dowlson, the rough old ferryman,
after an Axholmian farmer had briefly recounted the
pedlar's tale; "but I've heeard many sich i' my time,&mdash;thof
I nivver seed nowt mysen."</p>

<p>"And the Lord send I nivver may!" ejaculated
Betty Bogglepeep, a tottering old wife of Owston,
who had, the day before, as she said, in the course of
her gossip, chopped off the head of her best black
hen, because she crowed like a cock:&mdash;"the Lord
send I nivver may, for it maks me queer to think a
thowt o' sich things; and I'm sewer if I woz to see
'em, it would freeten me oot o' my wits!"</p>

<p>"Hold thy foolish tongue, prithee!" chimed in
her loving husband, whose bravery seemed chiefly
owing to his late fellowship with Sir John Barleycorn,
at the market:&mdash;"why does ta talk aboot being
freeten'd at shadows?"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, Davy, it's to no use puttin' it off i'
that way," interjected the old ferryman, taking up
the cause of the old woman and the ghost, with the
fervour of gallantry and faith united;&mdash;"depend on't,
though deead folks may come like shadows, yet it's
a fearful seeght to see 'em!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"No doot, no doot, Diggory!" replied the farmer,
"but seeing 'em's <i>all</i>&mdash;thoo knaws!"</p>

<p>The farmer meant this for an arch sally, but his
companions in the boat were not in the vein to relish
his humour.</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> think aboot sich solemn things,
Dame Thrumpkinson?" asked the old ferryman,
turning to the corner of the boat where Deborah
seemed buried in reflection;&mdash;"you sit and say not a
word, all this time. Give us your thowts, dame,
for ye've more sense than all of us, put together!"</p>

<p>"I don't give heed to every fool's tale about such
things," replied Dame Deborah, in her usual grave
tone; "but I've serious reason for believing that the
dead often know what the living are doing."</p>

<p>"Why, did ye ivver see owt spirit'al, Dame
Thrumpkinson?" instantly asked half-a-dozen voices,
while twice as many eyes glared upon the aged Deborah
with a gaze as wonder-stricken as that of a
nest of owls suddenly awakened by daylight.</p>

<p>"Nay, neighbours, nay!" replied the dame, drooping
her head, and speaking in a tone of melancholy
tenderness;&mdash;"do not ask me further. I think we
ought to keep sacred the secrets of the dead that
have been near and precious to us!"</p>

<p>The manner of Dame Deborah's reply was so
affecting, and its intimate meaning, though only
guessed by her rude auditors, seemed to command
so deep a respect from their simple feelings, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
subject was immediately dropped; and the whole
party remained silent until the boat had touched the
western bank of the river.</p>

<p>Some of the company now took a direction for
Owston and Butterwick, and such parts of the
country as lay on the banks of the Trent; while the
remnant, who were bound for the more central parts
of the isle, being more strongly mounted than Joe
and his aged mistress, and many of them having
a greater distance to reach ere night-fall, sped on
before, after bidding their deeply-respected acquaintance,
Dame Deborah, a hearty and kindly farewell.
The journey home was nearly ended before the dame
broke silence, her mind seeming deeply intent on
thoughts which the conversation in the boat had
awakened within her; and when she addressed her
foster-son, it was but briefly, though kindly.</p>

<p>"I hope the ride will do thee no harm, bairn,"
she said, in a tone of the gentlest affection; "and
how did ta spend the half-crown?"</p>

<p>"I bought a book with it, dame," Joe answered.</p>

<p>"A book!" said she, pleasantly:&mdash;"well, well, it's
like thee: but, may be, thou could not ha' spent it
better. And what sort of a book is it, bairn?"</p>

<p>"Quite on a new subject," Joe replied, scarcely
knowing how to describe the book to the dame's
plain understanding.</p>

<p>"A new subject!" she repeated, with a gentle
laugh;&mdash;"well, well, I hope it will do thee more good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
than some of thy old subjects." And then, as if
fearful of bringing back distressful thoughts to the
heart of one over whom she yearned so tenderly,
the good old dame permitted the journey to end
without further remark. Joe would fain have entreated
an explication of the mysterious conclusion
given by his aged protectress to the conversation in
the boat; but there was something too sombre in her
mood of mind, at that time, he thought, to permit
his hazarding any reference to such a subject.</p>

<p>Almost insensibly, to himself, Joe's opinions on
religious matters began to undergo an entire change
within a short period succeeding his acquaintance
with the work of the French philosopher. The arguments
of the book were conducted in too covert a
mode for one, so little skilled in the arts of disguise,
to be able to detect its real tendency in the outset.
The blandishments of the writer's style captivated
his taste; and the boldness with which he saw the
doctrines of natural liberty asserted, took strong
possession of his judgment. Degraded as his reason
had felt itself to be while enslaved to the teachings
of fanaticism, there was no wonder that he felt the
awakening of a desire for mental independence, and
listened willingly to the voice of an advocate for the
native dignity of man's understanding. Appended
to the volume, which now began to engross his leisure
hours, was a treatise, entitled "The Law of Nature."
Joe perused its precepts and digested its reasonings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
until he believed he had committed a lamentable
error by wearying his flesh and spirit with acts of
ascetic devotion,&mdash;and resolved he would address
himself to the practice of the elevated moral virtue
which the French writer asserted to be easy and
natural to man when brought within the influence
of instruction.</p>

<p>The native activity of his intellect prevented a prolonged
abidance on the mere threshold of opinion:
a few months rolled over, and Joe's convictions took
a current which they kept for some years. In truth,
the formation of his conclusions was hastened by the
very circumstance of his being compelled to pursue
his doubts and inquiries in silence. No one around
him understood the questions with which his mind
was grappling; and the answers which his own judgment
gradually gave them, would, he was sensible,
create a general horror if broadly proclaimed in the
hearing of the simple people by whom he was surrounded.</p>

<p>His faith once shaken in the rules of practice prescribed
by the sectarian teachers, since he knew no
other way of interpreting the experimental doctrines
of the Scriptures than that they pursued,&mdash;his reason
became gradually distasted with the Scriptures
themselves,&mdash;and he easily adopted the arguments
against the Bible contained in his favourite volume
of French philosophy. He began to suspect, and, at
length, boldly concluded, that the Jehovah of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Hebrews was, indeed, the mere mythological fiction
of a rude and barbarous age,&mdash;a Deity scarcely more
godlike in his character and attributes than the savage
Moloch of the Ammonites. To class the garden
of primeval innocence, and the forbidden fruit, and
the tempting serpent, and the lapse of the first
human pair, among the allegories which, he now
learned, the ancient nations were wont to adopt in
order to embody their conceptions of things otherwise
difficult of narration, was a still easier step.
The Prophecies, he thought, were evidently attributable
to that prolific Oriental faculty which gave
birth and authority to the pagan oracles; and the
Miracles, as events opposed to general experience,
were to be at once discarded from the catalogue of
historic facts, by every true philosopher.</p>

<p>Amid these rapid and decided changes of sentiment,
Joe sometimes wondered that he felt none of
the inward terror and the "stings of conscience,"
which he had so perpetually been taught to regard
as the sure avenging vicegerents of a Deity, in the
breasts of those who dared to doubt revealed truth.
That he was tormented by none of these appalling
visitings, was another proof to his mind of the fallacy
of his rejected teachers. He was conscious that,
in his conclusions, whether right or wrong, he was
sincere: he was satisfied that his new mental condition
was far preferable to the spirit-degrading and
wearisome slavery he had so recently shaken off;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and he had not, yet, sufficiently probed the depths of
his own heart to know that his self-gratulation was
also aided by the pride of thinking diversely from
the mass of his fellows. The ghost story at the
market, and its accompanying circumstances, often
ran through his memory, and served, not a little, to
enforce his persuasion that the mass of mankind were
the dupes of superstition; and, at the close of every
similar train of reflection, he could not refrain from
indulging a self-complacent feeling on his having,
himself, thrown off what he gradually deemed to be
a blind and implicit trust in fables under the delusive
guise of Divine inspiration.</p>

<p>Glowing with the conception that he had hitherto
been living in a dream of multiform illusions, but
had now broken it, Joe resolved to "gird up the
loins of his mind" for the laborious and persevering
pursuit of solid knowledge; and said within himself,&mdash;"I
will henceforth converse with experience, and
not with imagination: I will cleave to fact and not to
phantasy." The weekly journies to Gainsborough
with his aged mistress, which were uninterruptedly
kept up from their commencement, afforded him what
he conceived to be ample means for carrying this
resolve into successful practice. And so, in some
measure, it proved; for, by an exchange of volumes
with the travelling bookseller, and the casual assistance
of a few shillings from his indulgent godmother,
he reaped an unremitting supply for his intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
appetite,&mdash;a faculty which rapidly "grew with what
it fed on." He eagerly devoured whatever came
within his reach in the shape of history or chronicle;&mdash;he
sought industriously to acquire the rudiments
of real science;&mdash;and strove to sharpen and fortify
his reason by the perusal of ancient tomes of logic
and philosophy. For records of travel he craved
with an incontrollable passion: a feeling which was,
in reality, but a revivification of the ardour awakened
in his boyish mind by the adventures of the shipwrecked
Crusoe. But the fervid desire he once
cherished, to penetrate vast deserts and visit unknown
realms, was now transmuted, by the influence of his
more sober associations and habits of reflection, into
a prevalent wish to see the world of men; and the
prospect of a new and wider field of observation to
be entered upon at the close of his humble servitude
began thenceforth to pervade his daily musings, and,
eventually, to take a shape in his purposes.</p>

<p>The secrecy which Joe was compelled to observe
on religious subjects was a restraint through which
he would gladly have broken; but there was not one
to whom he could communicate his sceptical views
without fear of an explosion of alarm. Observance
of caution being repulsive to his feelings, it was,
therefore, natural that his real sentiments should
occasionally escape. Only, however, when the gross
superstitions of his daily associates excited very
strong disgust within him, did Joe utterly forget his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
rules of caution. His fellow-apprentices were in
little danger of imbibing heretical opinions, from the
fact of their understandings being too uninformed to
apprehend the real drift of his thinkings when expressed.
But Dame Deborah pondered on some of
these hasty expressions of opinion, until her aged
heart often ached with the suspicion that all was not
right in the new religious state of her foster-son.
Yet, when she marked the tenour of his daily conduct,&mdash;his
inviolable regard for truth,&mdash;his steady
rebuke of every thing coarse and unfeeling,&mdash;when
she listened to the language in which his conceptions,
even on ordinary subjects, were uttered,&mdash;and when
she contrasted his manly cheerfulness with his former
gloom and despondency, a confidence arose that dispelled
her temporary doubts of the correctness of his
heart, and her bosom glowed with pride at the remembrance
that she had adopted him for her own.</p>

<p>During the concluding five years of his apprenticeship,
Joe had piled together in his mind, though after
no prescribed rule, much knowledge of a multifarious
character. The acquirement of one of the noble
languages of antiquity was his severest unassisted
struggle during this probationary course; but it was
a strife from which he reaped the richest after-pleasures.
The facts he gleaned from history were stored
up faithfully in his memory, not merely as chronological
items, but as texts for fertile and profitable
reflection; while he assiduously strove to catch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
rays of such new truths as were perceptible in his
more limited reading of ethics, and to evince their
spirit in his thoughts and actions. Thus, without
written pattern or oral instructor, the orphan apprentice
endeavoured, by the selection of such materials
as lay within his grasp, to build up, within
himself, a mental fabric of seemly architecture. But,
to cut short observations that are already too protracted,&mdash;Joe,
with all his efforts after mental discipline,
was, at twenty-one, what all the lonely
self-educated must be at that age, often the slave of
his own hypothesis when he believed himself to be
following the most legitimate deductions from an
authenticated fact,&mdash;oftener a visionary than a true
philosopher.</p>

<p>On the evening preceding the day of Joe's freedom,
the good old Deborah, sitting at her own door,
presented a picture almost identical with the sketch
attempted at the opening of this brief recital. Except
the deeper furrows on her face, there was no
token that age had strengthened its empire over her.
The fine old woman sat as erect in her arm-chair as
she had sat there sixteen years before. Her eyes
also beamed with the same wakefulness and kindliness
on her neighbours, as they passed by, from their
labour, and tendered her a respectful recognition,&mdash;for
she was at peace with all, and beloved by all;
and while the light vapour curled and wreathed, as
it floated slowly upward from her pipe, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
melted, above her head, into the invisibility of space,
it seemed a type of the serene and healthful course
she had trod in her uprightness, that was, in due
time, to receive its quiet change into the unseen but
felicitous future. The solicitude she had, for seventeen
years, increasingly felt respecting the welfare of her
foster-son,&mdash;now the youth was within a few hours
of being at age,&mdash;filled her heart so completely, that
she could do nothing as she sat in her customary
seat, that evening, but con over the probable consequences
of Joe's emancipation from the thraldom of
apprenticeship, which was to take place the following
noon.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm truly thankful," soliloquised the peaceful
septuagenarian, puffing away the clouds from her
pipe with growing energy, and now and then ending
her sentences in an audible tone, through the strength
of earnestness,&mdash;"that the Lord moved my heart to
take care of this poor motherless and faytherless bairn.
It's Him, I'm sensible, that inclines us to do any
good,&mdash;for there's little that's good in us by natur'.
I've no reason to repent what I did; for though the
dear lad has a few whirligig notions, yet I'm sure
there's a vast deal o' good in him. He doesn't like
church over well,&mdash;but then the parson grows old
and stupid, like me; and it's not likely that a young
fellow that's grown so very book-larnt as our Joe,
should be fond o' spending his time in listening to an
old toothless parson's dull drawling. Neighbour Toby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Lackpenny says that the lad's ower nat'ral; and not
abstrac' enough, in his way o' thinking; but, for my
part, I think he's far ower abstrac' already! At
least, I hope he'll grow wiser, in a few years, than to
say that the dead never appear to the living. He
may talk in that way to green geese like himself,
but not to me. Didn't I see my own dear Barachiah,
for three nights together, stand in the moonlight, at
the foot of my bed, while I was weeping sore for the
loss of him?&mdash;The Lord forgive me, that I should
have grieved so sinfully as to have disturbed his rest!
But that's past and gone, and many a deep trouble
besides, thank Heaven above! And now, here's this
lad. I wished, often, that I had one o' my own;&mdash;but
it was not God's will so to bless my poor Barachiah
and me,&mdash;and how could I have loved a child
of my own better than I do love this poor bairn?
But I was thinking about what I must do for him
before he leaves me,&mdash;for he's long talked o' seeing
the world when he was out of his time;&mdash;and, I make
no doubt, he'll want to be off to-morrow, as soon as
noontide makes him free. I must say a few words
to him about it, to-night,&mdash;and yet, I feel so chicken-hearted
about his going, that I hardly know how to
speak to him."</p>

<p>The good dame's irregular soliloquy was put an
end to by the voices of her younger apprentices, who
were drawing homewards for the night. Her foster-son
soon afterwards made his appearance,&mdash;book in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
hand, as usual, at the end of his evening's walk at
the conclusion of labour. The supper-table was
spread,&mdash;the meal ended,&mdash;and Joe and the aged
dame were speedily left the sole occupants of the
little kitchen. Joe had retaken up his book, and had
been buried for more than half-an-hour in deep attention
to its contents,&mdash;the hour was growing late;&mdash;and
Dame Deborah, after many inward struggles,
began, in a very tremulous tone, to address her foster-child
on the most important theme in her recent
soliloquy.</p>

<p>"Joe," said she, "I was thinking, since you will
be of age, and a freeman, to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;" and there
her emotion compelled her to hesitate; but although
Joe had laid down his book to attend to his aged
protectress, he felt too much agitated to take up the
observation where the dame had left it.</p>

<p>"I reckon you are in the same mind about leaving
me, Joe," resumed the aged woman, trembling with
extreme feeling, and uttering the sentence with a
cadence that sounded like the key-note of desolation;&mdash;"but
I wish you to say what you are intending to
do when I give you your indentures, to-morrow at
noon."</p>

<p>"My kind mother,&mdash;for a true mother you have
been to me," replied the youth, forcibly subduing his
feelings, and addressing Dame Deborah with a degree
of animation and a fervency of look she had seldom
witnessed in him,&mdash;"it is high time I became ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>quainted
with the world. Believe me,&mdash;I do not
desire to leave you through ingratitude for your unremitted
kindness to a poor orphan,&mdash;but I feel I am
fitted for other scenes than these. More than all,
man is the great book I wish to read; and the few
humble pages of his history which lie around me here
I have turned over, till I am weary of the writing.
I shall be useless to you if I remain, for I shall never
be content, or at rest. I go from you, for a season;
but never, never, dear mother, shall I cease to think
of you!"</p>

<p>Joe bowed his head, and covered his face with his
hands, in deep emotion; and the dame, moved utterly
beyond self-possession, arose with trembling haste,
and clasping her foster-child in her aged arms, kissed
his fair forehead, while the unwonted tears trickled
down her furrowed cheeks.</p>

<p>"My dear bairn! my pratty bairn! my noble
bairn!" exclaimed she with a bounding heart, as she
stood over him in affectionate admiration.</p>

<p>Joe wept, in spite of his efforts to master tears,&mdash;but,
at length, recovered sufficient self-possession to
lead his aged protectress back to her chair, and to
recommence the conversation.</p>

<p>"You will consent, then, I hope, to let me go,
kind mother," he said, still holding her hand.</p>

<p>"The Lord's will be done, bairn!" replied Deborah,
in a tone of calm and natural piety. "Yes,"
added she, with resumed cheerfulness, and in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
customary firm under-tone,&mdash;"thou shal' go, Joey,
lad! and thy pocket shall not be empty, nayther!"</p>

<p>"Nay, dear mother," answered the high-minded
lad,&mdash;"I have already burdened you too heavily,
and I will never consent to rob you of the refuge of
your old age:&mdash;remember, I have hands and health,
and can work for my own support."</p>

<p>"God forbid thou should'st be idle!" answered the
dame;&mdash;"for idleness leads to sin and crime, while
honest labour needs never be ashamed. But a few
guineas in thy pocket will do thee no harm, an' thou
husbands 'em well. More than that, 'There's no
knowing what a man may have to meet when he
leaves home,' thou know'st is an old saying, and
thou'lt find it so apt, that thou'lt think on't when
thou has left me, mayhap."</p>

<p>A calm and provident conversation ensued, during
which Joe agreed to accept a purse of twenty spade-aces
from the good old dame, after she had assured
him it would by no means straiten her means either
of subsistence or plenty.</p>

<p>"And now, dear Joey," said the kind old woman,
"let me persuade thee to throw aside some o' thy
whirligig notions. Do not contradict every body
thou meets who are so old-fashioned as to believe
what their forefathers taught 'em. More than all,
Joey," continued Deborah, with some warmth, "I'm
shocked at your stubbornness in trying to deny what
the Scripter says about foul spirits:&mdash;the Lord keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
us from them!&mdash;and, especially at your daring to
threap so stoutly that the dead never come again!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, dame," replied Joe, in a tone of conciliation
and respect, "I never denied these things
out of stubbornness, but because they are opposed to
all experience:&mdash;who, and where, is the person, now
living, that has really seen a ghost?"</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;and where&mdash;Joe?" echoed Deborah,
with a strange and solemn look.</p>

<p>Joe felt amazed that he had not, before he had
asked the last question, called to mind the dame's
serious observations in the ferry-boat, five years before,
and sat gazing upon the changed countenance
of his aged mistress with intense earnestness.</p>

<p>"Joe," continued Deborah, after a deep pause succeeding
her emphatic echo of the youth's sceptical
question,&mdash;"I thought to have kept what I am about
to reveal of the dead as a solemn secret, and to have
buried it with me, in my grave; but to save thee
from foul unbelief about such solemn things, I will
reveal it to thee.</p>

<p>"Wedded husband and wife could not live in
greater happiness than my dear Barachiah and I,"
continued the aged woman, in a voice faltering with
affection:&mdash;"the stroke which took him from me
raised a murmuring spirit within me, and day after
day, as I moved about this dwelling, my rebellious
heart dared to say that He who lives on high, and
does all things well, had stricken me in wrath that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
deserved not. My neighbours would often attempt
to soothe me; and some of them treated my sorrow
with lightness, and said, I would soon forget my
dead husband, and seek another. But they who
uttered this mockery little knew me. Added days
and nights only served to increase my grief; and, at
length, I began to watch through the night, until my
strength failed, and, as I watched, I prayed, in sinful
stubbornness and presumption, that my Maker would
either take me away to join the dear being that I
loved, or bring him once more to me. It was done
unto me according to my wicked prayer;&mdash;for, one
midnight, about ten months after my dear Barachiah's
death, as I sat up in bed, with the burning
desire in my heart to see my husband once more, and
giving full vent to my rebelliousness by the utterance
of words which I remember with horror,&mdash;behold!
he whom I had lost stood at the foot of my bed,
but with such a piercing look of reproof as I never
saw him wear when alive. He wore a garment of
lovely light, and I could have delighted for ever to
gaze on him, had it not been for that severe look
which ran through my heart, and told me I had done
wrong. I sank away, senseless. When I came to
myself, and the vision was gone, I vowed that I
would never pray more as I had done that night.
But, my will was perverse; and, on the next night,
I was tempted again to desire, and then to pray, that
I might, yet once more, see my departed husband.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
I was punished as before;&mdash;but such was my wickedness,
or my weakness, I cannot tell which, that I
prayed yet a third time, as presumptuously as ever,
and was visited by another and still more reproving
apparition of him God gave to me, and whom He
had taken away. The next morning I was unable
to attend to my daily cares, and was compelled to
send for a physician. I took medicines, but I think
they helped less to heal me, than did the kind counsel
of the aged man who administered them, and who is
now in his grave. I prayed no more the prayer of
the presumptuous, but asked for resignation, till He
who has promised to be a husband to the widow,
filled my bosom therewith."</p>

<p>Deborah ceased, as it seemed, disabled by the
fullness of her heart, from prolonging her narrative.
Joe had not only listened to her revelation with the
profoundest attention, but felt an irresistible awe
under the recital. Deborah had never risen so much
above her ordinary self, in his eyes, as while she was
thus unbosoming a secret she had kept for years.
Her attitude, and the expression of her features, her
tone of voice, and the very words in which she conveyed
her solemn story, indicated an unusual frame
of mind, and formed a combined and undeniable
proof that the utterer of such unearthly news was as
fully persuaded, as of her own existence, that she was
delivering truths.</p>

<p>Joe's strong affection for his aged protectress, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
his reverence for her sterling uprightness, contributed
to fix his mind more absorbingly on what he heard.
The relation of the apparition of Barachiah Thrumpkinson,
although authenticated solely by this solemn
averment of his aged relict, thus made a stronger impression
on the faith of the youthful listener than any
former narrative of the supernatural, written or oral.
The united reasonings of five years seemed to be
shaken to atoms; and Joe remained answerless, with
his eyes fixed on the floor. Nor had his reasoning
faculty re-asserted its dominion, ere the aged dame
rose, and looking parentally upon him, while she uttered
her usual evening farewell, "Good night,
bairn!" took the way to her rustic couch.</p>

<p>Joe returned the salutation with a faltering voice,
and hasted, likewise, to seek his place of repose; but
sleep was long ere it visited his eyes, even when he
had overcome, in some degree, the strange over-awed
feeling which had crept over him while listening to
Deborah's story. Amid the solemn stillness of the
night, Memory ran through her beaten paths, and
Imagination arose, and mingled therewith the scenes
of the future. The great event of to-morrow,&mdash;the
greatest, hitherto, in the life of the humble shoemaker's
apprentice,&mdash;soon dissipated all other excitements.
Would he be happier when he was free,
and had entered the world, as a personal observer,
instead of learning its varied character from books?
Something whispered a doubt. But would he not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
be wiser? Yes; that, he thought, was certain. He
would be able, by the practice of close observation,
to compare men with each other: he would have the
opportunity of trying, as upon a touch-stone, the
truth or fallacy of the peculiar hypotheses he had
framed: he would learn to read the human heart.
And then he thought of the probability, nay, certainty,
of his finding some kindred mind, but farther
advanced in great truths, that would be able to set
him right where he was wrong; who would teach
him the true secret of perfecting his moral nature,
and would lead him on to the acquirement of intellectual
stores, of the very existence of which, it
might be that he had scarcely a faint conception,&mdash;thoughts
that enfevered him with pleasurable anticipation.</p>

<p>Then, reverting to the past, he reminded himself
of his orphan condition, of the gratitude he owed
his affectionate foster-mother, and of the kind and
parental assistance she had offered him, although he
was about to desert her. Often he felt the melting
mood come over him so conqueringly, that he was
all but resolved to tell the aged dame, in the
morning, that he would remain with her, and try to
comfort her old age. And then he thought of the
many sensible lessons she had given for his future
conduct in the world,&mdash;till, wearied out with the
variety of his thoughts, and physically, as well as
mentally exhausted, he sunk to slumber.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe awoke early, after a dreamless and refreshing
sleep, and again his mind laboured with its difficulties
about Deborah's relation of the apparition; but its
labour was vain. The more he reasoned the greater
were his difficulties. The healthful effect of these
baffled and perplexed thinkings upon Joe's intellect
was, the deterring of its powers from precipitant and
immature conclusions,&mdash;the throwing of its energies
back upon fresh and deeper inquiry,&mdash;and the in-fixing
of a humiliating consciousness that, after all his
struggles in pursuit of knowledge, he scarcely knew
any thing yet as he ought to know it. Thus, his conscious
ignorance for the present was really beneficial
to him; and when the voice of his affectionate mistress
was heard summoning him to breakfast, he
stept down the ladder, shaking his head at himself
for a conceited puppy, and applying homeward to his
own case the significant rebuke&mdash;</p>

<p>
"There are more things in heaven and earth, <i>Joe</i>,<br />
Than are dreamt of in <i>your</i> philosophy."<br />
</p>

<p>Labour, the honest dame declared, should not be
thought of, in her house, the day that Joe was of
age,&mdash;according to her reckoning by guess,&mdash;and
free. And she bustled about, as old as she was, to
place her best earthen jugs, filled with mead and ale,
in goodly array, on the white and well-scoured table,
that every visiter might drink the young freeman's
health; and she hasted to prepare a large plumb-pudding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and other homely eates, for dinner,&mdash;all the
while holding up her head, and striving to look as
blythe and merry as if she had been in her teens.</p>

<p>At length, the hour of parting came; and when
Joe rose and took up his hat,&mdash;and his fellow-apprentices
that were,&mdash;but a few hours before,&mdash;took
each a bundle to accompany him a few miles on the
way,&mdash;Dame Deborah's aged frame shook violently,
and the tears streamed, unchecked, down her time-worn
face.</p>

<p>"God speed thee, my dear bairn!" she cried,&mdash;"and
help thee to take heed of thy ways, that no
harm may befall thee!"</p>

<p>Joe felt completely unmanned, and mingled his
tears with those of his beloved and revered benefactress,
while he bent to receive her parting benediction.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The orphan saw his foster-mother no more alive.
When, three years afterwards, he again entered that
little village of Haxey, it was to attend the interment
of Dame Deborah in the same churchyard to
which she had conducted him to witness the burial of
his mother. And what an altered man was Joe! A
residence in the manufacturing districts had unveiled
to him a world of misery&mdash;contention&mdash;competition&mdash;avarice&mdash;oppression&mdash;and
suffering&mdash;and famine&mdash;that
he had never supposed to exist! As for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
religious opinions they changed, and changed again,&mdash;amidst
varnished, high-sounding professors of sanctity,
on the one hand,&mdash;and starving thousands, who in the
pangs of despair charged God with the authorship of
their wretchedness, on the other. Had Joe been
asked, ten years afterwards, what were <i>now</i> his religious
sentiments, he would have answered:&mdash;"I
am wearied with talking about creeds, and I am trying,&mdash;by
relieving misery as much as I can, and
diffusing all the happiness I can,&mdash;to show that I
believe all men to be my brethren: I think <i>that</i> is
the best religion."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>TOBY LACKPENNY THE PHILOSOPHICAL:</h2>

<p class="center">A
DEVOTEE OF THE MARVELLOUS.</p>


<p>Among the most remarkable events which took place
in Haxey, towards the close of the last century, was
the settlement, in that ancient village, of curious
Toby Lackpenny, the philosophical tailor. Toby's
coat was usually out at the elbows, but he had long
held, throughout the whole Isle of Axholme, a high
reputation as a man of deep and singular learning.
His "library" was the theme of marvel unceasing
to his plain and unsophisticated customers; and
though it consisted but of forty or fifty ragged volumes,
it constituted a wealth that the philosophical
Toby, himself, priced above rubies. To this treasury
of wisdom he, nightly, resorted, with ever-fresh delight,
as regularly as his manual labour closed; and
many an ecstatic hour did he live over his books in
the sweet stillness and solitude of early morning.
There were tractates on the whole circle of science,
in his bibliographical collection, Toby asserted; for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
like all other great philosophers, he aspired to be
an encyclopedist in knowledge: but, up to the time
at which we are commencing this brief record of
Toby's history, it was simply, by his mastery of the
erudite pages of Nicholas Culpepper,&mdash;and of a very
ancient volume comprising treatises on Astrology,
Geomancy, Palmistry, and other kindred occult studies,&mdash;that
Toby had won for himself, throughout
the length and breadth of Axholmian land, so high a
character for wisdom. None could doubt the profundity
of Toby's acquirements; for whoever took a
wild flower to his door was sure to be told its name,&mdash;its
healing virtues,&mdash;and the names of its presiding
influences, the planets and zodiacal constellations,&mdash;those
celestial potencies from which, he assured the
visiter, every herb and flower derived their medicinal
virtues. And, oh! the decoctions, and the salves,
and the ointments, and the plasters, and the poultices,
and the liniments, and the electuaries, and the
simples, and the compounds, that were made by the
old women of Haxey, and all Axholme, by Toby
Lackpenny's oracular direction! And then the exultant
looks and honied words with which some
would return thanks to Toby, and assure him all
their tooth-ache, or head-ache, or elbow-ache, had
vanished, like magic, by their diligent attention to
his prescription; and then the reach and shrewdness
he displayed in answering such as complained that
his advice had not been of the service they had ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>prehended,
namely, that they had not plucked the
flower in the hour when its own planet presided,&mdash;or
they had not boiled it before the Moon rose,&mdash;and
she was in opposition to Jupiter, the lord of the plant
wormwood,&mdash;or some other convincing reason why
the device had not succeeded.</p>

<p>Toby's advancement in the "astral science," also
brought him an increasing number of customers,&mdash;though
the naked condition of his elbows told the
fact that this growing knowledge was somewhat profitless
in a substantial sense. Nevertheless, every
successive day strengthened his confidence that he
would soon be "even with Booker, or Lilly, or
Gadbury, or any of 'em that his grandfather used to
talk about;"&mdash;for he had also been eager, in his day,
to be able to prognosticate future events by tracing
"the stars in their courses." And, now, as surely
as the evening returned, Toby might be seen at his
own door, seated on a low stool, drawing astrological
diagrams on a fragment of slate, and placing the
symbols of the planets and signs of the zodiac in due
position in the "table of houses."</p>

<p>The vagueness which Toby found to be so characteristic
of what astrologers call the "rules of
judgment" often brought the zealous student to a
pause, as to the real utility of his pursuit; but the
extreme credulousness of his constitution usually
urged him to put an end to the dubious reasonings
that often rose within him. Now and then, a sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
stroke from the village parson,&mdash;levelled, in full canonicals,
from the pulpit of a Sunday forenoon,&mdash;with
the marksman's stern eye fixed, meanwhile, on
poor Toby,&mdash;made him stagger a little. It was a
guilty act,&mdash;the clergyman asserted,&mdash;to rend away
the natural veil which the Creator had drawn over
man's discernment of futurity: it was a controversion
of the order of His Providence: it was an attempt
to seize upon the Almighty's own attributes, and
wield a power that belonged solely to Himself. Such
eloquent sentences bothered Toby still more, when
the well-intentioned shepherd rounded them by exclaiming,
as he beat the</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"&mdash;&mdash;drum ecclesiastic</span><br />
With fist instead of a stick,"<br />
</p>

<p>that "star-gazers, and wizards, and enchanters, were,
each and all, an abomination to the Lord!"</p>

<p>But, alas! for poor Toby,&mdash;when his favourite
disciple Joe, after being torn from him by Dame
Deborah's commandment in obedience to Toby's
great foe,&mdash;the vicar,&mdash;alas! for Toby, when Joe,
filled with zeal to discharge his conscience, re-entered
the tailor's cottage one evening at dusk, and attacked
his old teacher in the very heart and centre of his
predilections, declaring there would be no salvation
for him in this world, till he had followed the example
of the Ephesian Christians, and burnt his cabalistical
books; nor any happiness for him in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
prospect of a future life, until he had eschewed all
his delusive vanities, and cried at the footstool of his
Maker for the pardon of his sins! Never was the
might with which a mind sinewed by some strong
enthusiasm controls even an elder and more experienced
intellect more signally evinced than in the
contest between the orphan Joe, under his religious
frenzy, and his old teacher, the soothsaying tailor.
In the outset of this strange opposition and aggression
on the part of his late scholar, Toby Lackpenny
stoutly parried the blows of his unexpected adversary
by returning text for text, and argument for
argument.</p>

<p>"Is it not plainly declared in the Book of Judges,
that 'the stars in their courses fought against Sisera?'"
asked Toby, with all the emphasis which his
zeal for the hereditary honour and power of the stars
prompted;&mdash;"can any thing prove more clearly that
they sway human affairs? And the inspired Psalmist
saith of the heavenly bodies, that 'Their line is gone
out through all the earth, and their words to the end
of the world.' Which word <i>line</i>, according to Aben
Ezra, and the most skilful cabalists," continued
Toby, diving into the profoundest depths of his
learning for the defence of his beloved theories,
"ought to be rendered <i>rule</i> or <i>direction</i>, and evidently
sets forth the fact that the planets exercise
lordship in their respective houses,&mdash;while the latter
part of the passage makes known the precious truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
that the wise and skilful student will learn to understand
their language."</p>

<p>"But you have studied their language a long time
without understanding it a whit the surer,&mdash;you
know you have,&mdash;for you have told me so more than
once, neighbour Toby," replied Joe, with honest and
unshrinking fervour; "and as your head is fast becoming
grey, and as flowers are often nipped though
but in the bud,&mdash;I think it would be wiser in you
as an aged man, and in me as a frail youth, to get
prepared for death;&mdash;therefore, I conjure you,
Toby, as you value your own soul, to forsake these
vanities!"</p>

<p>This simple and sincere language, from one who
was then little more than a child in years, shook the
old man's heart more than all the clergyman's hortatory
thunderbolts had shaken his reason. Toby
attempted to renew his sophistries, at Joe's succeeding
visits; but felt, at length, thoroughly subdued under
the heartfelt and persevering enthusiasm of a mere
boy.</p>

<p>"Verily!" Toby Lackpenny often exclaimed in
after-times, when relating the progress of his conversion,&mdash;"although
my will was stubborn, I often
trembled before the spirit of that child, like Felix
before Paul, or like the gaoler in the prison at
Philippi!"</p>

<p>The astrologer burnt his books of the astral science,
and all the other occult, and therefore satanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
sciences; and he and Joe were thenceforth united in
a novel and more elevated pursuit,&mdash;the acquirement
of a purified and spiritual nature. But the
distinctness of minds, and the force of habit in different
natures, were strikingly discoverable in the relative
degrees of zeal with which the youth and Toby
followed their new object. Joe's ascetic fervour has
been described. But Toby's bent was of a diverse
character: he found it impossible to enter with Joe's
vehemence into the quest of an entire renewal of
heart,&mdash;and could not resist the tendency to seek for
enlightenment among the curious treasures of his
little library. With indescribable rapture Toby
found, as he thought, exactly what he wanted, in the
abstruse pages of Jacob B&oelig;hmen. He had long
kept the volumes of the mystical German on his
shelves; but he assured himself that he never saw the
true meaning of the high mysteries developed in the
"Forty Questions," with so clear a vision as he did
now the films of the "old Adam" were beginning
to fall from his eyes.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be observed that Joe heard Toby's
announcement of these abstract discoveries with rigid
indifference. Neither when the lad's fervour had
abated, and disgust and melancholy succeeded, did he
feel able to receive the tailor's assurances of the superior
consolation to be derived from these puzzling
studies. Toby's exhilaration of spirits, happily for
himself, suffered little interruption after the full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
growth of his devoted attachment to the cloudy exercitations
of the old quietest.&mdash;"Of a truth," he
would often say to his customers, "I can never be
sufficiently thankful that a merciful Providence showed
me the spiritual lantern of Jacob B&oelig;hmen, wherewith
I might find, and possess, the pearl of great
price!"</p>

<p>Within two years of the expiry of Joe's apprenticeship,
however, the devotional and marvel-loving
tailor had transferred his worship from the shrine of
the mystical German shoemaker to the more lofty, as
well as more celestial image of Baron Emanuel Swedenborg.
The Scripture histories had, thenceforth,
an allegorical sense for Toby, as well as for Joe; and
the lad could scarcely hint that he thought the transactions
in the garden of Eden were to be read as a
figure, before the learned Lackpenny was ready to
pour out a profound descant on the <i>proprium</i>, or
"sensual principle," which he affirmed to be typified
by the serpent in the garden;&mdash;and declared his conviction,
that the Mosaic account of the first human
pair was, in reality, a mere symbolical history of
"the First Church," and of the causes of its forfeiture
of purity.</p>

<p>At another argumentative season, when the apprentice
had ventured to ask if Toby did not think
there was something incongruous in the account of
Noah's flood, and in the size the ark was said to be,&mdash;and
how the beasts went in,&mdash;and how they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
were supported,&mdash;the penetrating Swedenborgian
assured the inquirer, with the utmost gravity, that
he thought there was nothing in the whole world of
books or facts more easy of explication.</p>

<p>"Know thou, my beloved Joey," said the sincere
old man, raising his spectacles, and placing them,
like two additional eyes, in the centre of his large
forehead, "that whoever giveth his hearty faith to
the teaching of the celestial-minded Swedenborg
will receive a second eye-sight,&mdash;spiritual, and far
more precious than the eyes of this earthly body.
The Deluge, Joey, represents 'the Second Church,'
as the garden of Paradise represents the first. The
ark is the man of the church; and the forty days'
rain is a figure for the temptations of the senses, by
which the Second Church, as well as the First, was
tried: you may see that figure plainly cleared up by
our Saviour's temptation in the wilderness. The
ark is also described as having a window above,&mdash;that
signifies the intellectual principle; and a door, moreover,
at the side,&mdash;that denotes the faculty of hearing."</p>

<p>"I wish all these things had been described in a
plainer way, if they mean all this," interjected the
youth, impatient of his mystic friend's harangue.</p>

<p>"<i>If!</i>" exclaimed Toby, astonished out of measure
that any sane person could, for one moment, doubt
what seemed to himself to be so pellucidly clear;&mdash;"if!&mdash;why,
only read it for yourself, Joe, in the
'Celestial Arcana' of the inspired Emanuel of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
North!"&mdash;and, therewith, the agile old philosopher
sprang from his chair, and reached the volume from
his shelves.</p>

<p>"Never mind, friend Toby: not at present," said
Joe, very quietly.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Toby, "another time then;&mdash;but
you won't hear me out, or otherwise I could
clearly prove what I had begun to say."</p>

<p>"But what confidence can one place in these
dreams of your favourite Emanuel?" said Joe.</p>

<p>"Dreams!" retorted the mystic tailor, lowering
his voice, and changing the expression of his countenance,
until Joe wondered what was the matter
with him.&mdash;"Dreams! no, no, he didn't dream,
Joey. He was favoured with heavenly visions!
The angels actually took him several times to heaven,&mdash;for
he says so himself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Mahomet said the same," interjected Joe.</p>

<p>"Interrupt me not!" continued Toby, looking still
more awfully mysterious:&mdash;"I tell thee, the angels
took him to heaven, and unfolded to him hidden mysteries!
And I tell thee, Joey, that I believe it is
possible to attain unto such a pure state here, in this
world, that we may converse with angels. I have
fasted every day this week till sunset," concluded the
poor honest old enthusiast, creeping close to Joe, and
speaking almost in his ear,&mdash;"and I have faith to
believe, that, in a little time, after much prayer, I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
even I, shall be permitted to see the angelic world,
yea, and to converse with it!"</p>

<p>One of Joe's fellow-apprentices here lifted up the
latch, and informed him that Dame Deborah wished
he would come home, for the hour was getting late.
Pressing his old friend's hand, without looking him
in the face, the youth wished him "Good-night!" not
a little relieved by the summons of his mistress.</p>

<p>On the morrow, the neighbourhood was thrown
into a state of alarm by a cottager having found
poor Toby Lackpenny in a swoon upon his shop-board.
Finding the experiment attended with such
imminent hazard, the fervent enthusiast was persuaded
the next night, by Joe, after two hours' indefatigable
argumentation, to lay aside his attempt,
by devout abstinence, at "purging the frame terrestrial
till it could witness the vision celestial."</p>

<p>The occurrence of a very singular incident, however,
and some effects that followed it, produced many
a misgiving in poor Toby's mind that he had done
wickedly in giving up the pursuit of this spiritual and
exalted object. It was about the third night after
Toby had yielded to Joe's prudent counsel,&mdash;and
while they were sitting in quiet converse on one of
their old themes,&mdash;that Toby's cottage door was
suddenly burst open by a blow which resembled the
stroke of a thunderbolt in the imagination of Joe and
his ancient gossip,&mdash;and, on the centre of the floor,
as suddenly stood Frank Friskit, Joe's younger fel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>low-apprentice,
and the most mischievous scape-grace
in the village. The face of the unexpected
visitant was like the whitened wall; and his curly
locks, as if in consternation at the unwonted pallor
of his countenance, stood "nine ways of a Wednesday,"
as Toby phrased it. His trembling knees
and torn dress made confession,&mdash;the trembler himself
being tongueless with dread,&mdash;that Frank had
been engaged in some fearful adventure. Joe hastened
to support him,&mdash;for the lad swooned almost
instantly. Toby hastened for cold water to aid his
recovery;&mdash;and, in a few seconds, Noah Wallhead,
Joe's other fellow-apprentice, also entered Toby's
cottage, and manifested considerable solicitude about
Frank's alarming condition. After a plentiful libation
upon his temples, Frank began to come to his
senses.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Franky?" said Toby, gently,
as soon as he thought the convalescent was able to
bear the inquiry.</p>

<p>"I've&mdash;I've seen some'at!" replied Frank, hysterically.</p>

<p>"Seen!&mdash;well, but what have you seen, Frank?"
asked Joe.</p>

<p>"A bar-ghost, Joe, or else th' old lad!" answered
Friskit, with a chattering of the teeth.</p>

<p>Noah Wallhead laughed; but Toby and Joe,
seeing the young ghost-seer was now able to sit up
without help, requested him, when they had closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the door, to tell his story at length, and conceal
nothing.</p>

<p>The repentant Frank avowed himself to be the
guilty perpetrator of a series of malicious attempts
upon the natural liberty of Toby Lackpenny's cat!
Every urchin in the village of Haxey had been
blamed, at one time or other, for the base machination
of setting "snickles," or nooses of wire, in the tailor's
little garden. The sage Toby profoundly conjectured,
and openly maintained, all along, that these wicked
devices were intended to ensnare his favourite tabby;
but neither he, nor any one else, had ever suspected
Frank Friskit to be the foul conspirator, inasmuch
as he was so frequently in Toby's cot, and on friendly
terms with him. Under the agitation of affright,
the conscience-stricken and self-discovered culprit
solemnly vowed that he would forsake the way of
transgression thenceforth; for he had seen such a
sight, while setting a snickle, as he could never forget
as long as he lived! How he had got over the hedge
he could not tell:&mdash;he believed his wits left him as
soon as he saw the bar-ghost,&mdash;for he could remember
nothing besides that queer sight!</p>

<p>"But what was it like, Frank?" asked Joe.</p>

<p>"Like!&mdash;why it had a dark-looking face, and a
pair of eyes as big as owls' heads!" replied the lad,
with a shudder.</p>

<p>"And how big was it?" asked Joe, again.</p>

<p>"I only saw the great foul face grinning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
staring at me, and all on a blaze,&mdash;and then it was
gone!" said Frank.</p>

<p>Joe received the last answer with a smile,&mdash;but,
on turning round, when Noah Wallhead touched his
elbow, he could not forbear laughter. Noah showed
Joe the hollow turnip, with its eyes and mouth, that
had so marvellously affrighted the younger apprentice
when lit up with a bit of candle,&mdash;a common trick
among rustic youngsters. Toby, however, was not
let into the secret, and took it very ill that Joe,
especially, should laugh at what he considered a very
alarming narrative. Feeling it incumbent on himself
to use this advantageous opportunity for enforcing
a homily on reform, he thus addressed himself
to the penitent Frank Friskit:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be thankful, foolish boy," he said, "that this
evil spirit has done thee no real harm; and, for the
future, lay aside thy wicked follies. And, above
all, Frank, bethink thee that thou has' been guilty
of a great sin to be so long pretending good neighbourship
with me, and yet to be all the while plotting
how to snickle my poor dumb creatur'. No wonder
the bar-ghost should visit thee! Say thy Belief, as
well as thy prayers, to-night, Frank,&mdash;and be a good
lad in futur', and then thou may' hope that the Lord
will forgive this deceit, for that's a greater sin than
mischief!"&mdash;and then, fearing to renew the lad's
terrors,&mdash;since he already began to tremble afresh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>&mdash;Toby
besought Joe and Noah Wallhead to take
him home.</p>

<p>Toby Lackpenny felt "indescribably queer," as
he afterwards said,&mdash;when left alone that night. He
tried to banish the remembrance of Frank's strange
description of the trunkless head,&mdash;but he found that
to be impossible, as long as he sat by the fire,&mdash;for
every flicker of the flames startled him with a new
fear or fancy. So he betook himself to bed. But
alas! poor Toby's frame had been so completely
weakened by fasting, and his indulgence of the
marvelling propensity of his constitution had rendered
his understanding and will so powerless, that
he felt like a being that has no longer any self-government.
The head,&mdash;the queer head that Frank
had seen,&mdash;with its fiery eyes and mouth,&mdash;was
all Toby could think about, as he lay tossing to and
fro in bed:&mdash;"What a marvellous sight it must
have been!" said Toby to himself,&mdash;"a grinning
dark face, with eyes as big as owls' heads,"&mdash;the
boy said;&mdash;"all on a blaze in a moment, and then
gone!" And the revolting picture, at length, burst
in reality,&mdash;he believed,&mdash;before his eyes! Nor had
he the power to banish the uncouth and distorted
phantasm,&mdash;although he gathered up all his courage
and tried to laugh, once:&mdash;it was in vain,&mdash;the
sound of his own forced laughter caused his skin to
creep! Then Toby shut his eyes, and turned himself
on his pillow, and bravely resolved he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
sleep,&mdash;but it still was in vain:&mdash;when his eyelids
ached with the compressure he had exerted upon
them, he opened his eyes once more,&mdash;and lo! there
was a real, grinning, goggle-eyed head,&mdash;all on fire,&mdash;coming
towards him, from an immense distance!
The trunkless head was a mile off, apparently,&mdash;but
it was coming,&mdash;and what was he to do? It came on
rapidly,&mdash;and the heart of poor Toby beat loudly
against his ribs, and the perspiration started from his
brow; and, at length, when the glaring phantom of
a head was approaching very near, he made a convulsive
effort, and dashed his head beneath the bed-clothes!
Half suffocated with heat and fear, he
threw the clothes sufficiently off to obtain a breath
or two, when, to his unspeakable relief, his incomprehensible
tantaliser vanished.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, however, the horrible spectre
of a head appeared again, in the immense, immeasurable
distance. It approached at the same rapid and
threatening rate as before, and with features he
thought still more frightful; and, again, he had
recourse to the bed-clothes for protection from this
terrific visitant. When the head commenced its
menacing approach for the third time, Toby's horror
exceeded endurance, and he jumped from his low
bed, and threw open his little window to catch the
cool air. The night breeze speedily dispelled his
giddiness, and effectually banished the disturbing
figure from his disordered sensory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Toby stood a few moments attempting to rally
his mind, by his old employment of counting the
stars in each of the more striking constellations,
which were at the time distinctly and brightly visible;&mdash;but
the hour of midnight, told by the solemn tones
of the church clock, warned him to close the window,
and endeavour to find the rest he felt he now so
much needed. Exhaustion, happily, came to his
relief, and Toby forgot the fiery head without a
trunk, in more gentle dreams.</p>

<p>Joe heard Toby's relation of this singular visit,
the next night, with a degree of phlegm and coolness
that amazed the marvel-stricken tailor. Nor could
Toby receive for gospel any of the natural explanations
of his young friend: it was in vain that
Joe recounted what he had lately read of Nicolai,
the printer of Berlin, and his wondrous diseased
visions,&mdash;it was equally in vain that the youth strove
to shew Toby that the very manner of the strange
head's visit,&mdash;so like what was called "phantasmagoria"
and other optical delusions,&mdash;proved, to a
dead certainty, that it all arose from over-excitement
of the brain. Toby poohed and pshawed at every
thing Joe said,&mdash;and was nearer than Joe had ever
thought him towards calling his former disciple by
some offensive name. The lad was compelled to
desist from his attempt to reason Toby out of his
uneasy conviction, that he had actually been visited
by some evil agent as a punishment for his infraction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
of the vow he took never to eat food till sunset,&mdash;that
so he might attain to communion with heavenly
angels!</p>

<p>Left to himself, the stricken idealist fell into still
more pernicious errors. Witchcraft, was the next
delusion he was fated to experience. Not that Toby
ever imagined himself to be either a witch or a
wizard; but he fell, most obstinately, into the belief,&mdash;ay,
as obstinately as the knight of La Mancha
himself,&mdash;that he was under the mischievous power
of some who dealt with wicked spirits and practised
enchantments. His imagination in this, as in earlier
instances of its treacherousness to his judgment, made
a rapid, though gradual, abandonment of all self-evident
and common-sense conclusions, even in the
every-day affairs of life. That nest of temptation&mdash;his
library&mdash;as, also, in the case of the world-known
Quixote, was, again, the source from which Toby
Lackpenny drew the written proofs for the reality
of his credulous vagaries. "Gloomy Glanvil," as
critical Toby had called him in the days of his
higher spiritual-mindedness, was the superstitious expounder
of doctrine to whom the philosophical tailor
now attached himself. How could he deny that a
compact with evil spirits was possible to fallen human
creatures, when he had believed, so heartily, with
Swedenborg, that it was possible for sinful man to
hold communion with celestial ministers? Besides,
was there not the indubitable history of the Witch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of Endor, and innumerable other references to
dealers with familiar spirits, in the volume of Holy
Writ? And were they likely&mdash;these wicked and
envious agencies of the "evil eye"&mdash;to look on any
human being so maliciously as on him who had
aspired to converse with good angels? Would they
not feel an instinctive antipathy towards him? He
was convinced they would, as soon as he inwardly
asked the question.</p>

<p>He had just lost his thimble while he was thinking
thus; and though he hunted for it a full hour, he
was not able to find it! What though this had often
fallen to his share of ill luck before? It was not,
now, to be accounted for as an accident. No: it
had been spirited away: he was bewitched; he was
sure he was. It was by petty acts of mischief that
the withered hags of hell usually commenced their
annoyance of those whose aspirations after purity
had raised their devilish hate. His case, he feared,
was too sure to prove a sorrowful one, for he knew
not how to counterwork their malevolence. What a
dunce he had been to neglect that branch of occult
study! But it might not be too late to acquire even
a profound knowledge of it; and so he would set
about it in right earnest.</p>

<p>And, poor Toby! he <i>did</i> set about it in earnest,
insomuch that he sewed side-seams to tops and bottoms
of new garments, and stitched circular patches
on square rents, and squares on circular apertures in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the damaged attire he undertook to repair, and mislaid
his thread where he could not find it for hours,&mdash;and
pricked his thumbs and fingers, half-callous
though they were, with the needles,&mdash;and heated
his goose till he burnt the cloth,&mdash;and fell into
blunders and mishaps of most awful consequence to
his professional reputation, day by day, more thickly
and disastrously, until the very disasters themselves
convinced him that he was approaching a climax of
knowledge in the gloomy science of which he had
now become so devoted a student. The witches
knew&mdash;foul, cunning, devil-dealers that they were&mdash;they
knew, although he did not, as yet, ken <i>who</i>
they were, that he was about to become a match for
them; and, therefore, they were thus bedevilling
him and his cloth, and goose, and shears, and thimble,
and needles, in this "hey-day, hide-and-seek, burn-it-and-bother-it,"
sort of way.</p>

<p>Toby would not "give it up," however, torment
him as they might&mdash;the spiteful fiendlings! He still
read and thought, and thought and read, and compared
the descriptions of feature which his books
contained, with the physiognomies of all who visited
his abode, until he entertained a shrewd suspicion of
who were the real and identical, though secret, practisers
of all this infernal mischief. Yet, as some of
these had been, for years, his best and kindest employers,
the witch-seer found it go sorely against the
grain of his affectionate nature to provoke a quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
with them. Often did he chide his spirit when he
had permitted any of these suspicious visiters to depart
with heartfelt thanks for the kindly present of
a cake, or a new cheese, or a dish of butter, or half-score
of eggs, with which they had coupled their
order for the repair of a coat, or nether habit; and
as often did he resolve to prepare himself against
their next visit for a red-hot quarrel.</p>

<p>Months elapsed before the amiable-hearted visionary
could "screw his courage to the sticking-place," so as
to enable him to "fall out" with his friends and
benefactors: not that he feared their witchery, or the
heavier harm it might bring upon him, when he had
defied it. He soon lost all dread of that kind. It was
his true-heartedness&mdash;his genuine gratitude&mdash;that
precious quality which a rogue never feels, though
he talks the most loudly about it, but which honest
and noble natures cannot stifle, even when warm
friends have become persecuting foes,&mdash;it was that
superlative virtue which struggled to keep its citadel
in gentle Toby's heart's core, and the contest with
which was so troublous to him. Happily for the
poor mistaken philosopher, his loving-heartedness had
rendered him so dear to all who knew him, that none
would believe he was in his right mind, when he suddenly
became so discourteous and angry-tempered.</p>

<p>"Pr'ythee, Goody, what think'st ta?" said Dolly
Dustit, the little hard-working flax-woman, to Peggy
the staid housekeeper at Farmer Robinson's,&mdash;"is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
neighbour Toby growing queerish in his heed, wi' so
much book-larning,&mdash;or, what the plague can be the
matter wi' him? I asked him to tell me what yerbs
I should get to mak' a green plaister for our Jack's
sore scaup, and he grinned like a fummard, and tell'd
ma to gooa to the divvil, and as th' oud lad was a
friend o' mine he would mak' ma my plaisters, with
a witness! Doesn't ta think he's gone stranny?"</p>

<p>"For sartain there's summat the matter wi' his
wits, from what our maister was saying about him
this morning," answered Peggy; "but who can
wonder at it, Dolly? I wonder his knowledge-box
hasn't gone wrong-side up'ards many a year since!"</p>

<p>"And Maister Robinson has had some foul speech
from him, has he, then, Peggy?" asked the little
flax-woman, curious to learn more of Toby's vagaries.</p>

<p>"Sich foul speech as maks one queer to mention
it," replied Peggy, though she evidently wanted to
unburthen herself of it to her gossip, and told the
shuddering news in the next breath:&mdash;"he tell'd
th' farmer that his breeches smelled o' brimstone, and
he wouldn't put a stitch in 'em to please ayther him,
or the divvil his maister!"</p>

<p>"The Lord ha' marcy on us, Peggy!" ejaculated
the honest little flax-woman, "it's a sore thing to
think on; but poor Toby's brain's addled at last,
I'm varry sewer. He's as harmless as a lamb, when
he's right: one nivver heeard a foul word come out
of his mouth. I'm varry sorry for him, Peggy&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and so saying, Dolly Dustit sped on to her daily
work in the flax field, more deeply grieved at what
she believed to be poor Toby's affliction, than at his
repulsive treatment of her application for his medical
advice.</p>

<p>Such conferences of inquiry, wonder, and regret,
began to arise daily, in the ancient little town of
Haxey, as Toby advanced further into the spirit and
essence of witch-knowing; but the erring philosopher,
at length, set the whole village into uproar by
telling no less-beloved a personage than Dame Deborah
Thrumpkinson, herself, that he believed she was
a witch,&mdash;nay the queen and ring-leader of all the
witches in the Isle of Axholme,&mdash;and, to complete
his madness, Toby actually strove to eject the venerable
old woman from his cottage! Fortunately, his
corporal weakness prevented him from effecting the
rudeness which he thus attempted; and the hearty
old dame, though pitying, rather than censuring his
folly, felt disposed to try the effect of a somewhat
vigorous reproof of it. Seizing the lean, attenuated
student by the collar, she laid him, with one sinewy
lift, fairly on his back, breathless and fear-stricken,
upon the shop-board.</p>

<p>"'Od rabbet thee, and thy fizzlegig foolery!" she
exclaimed, setting her teeth together, as she was
wont when moved more strongly than usual, "what
maggots hast thou got into thy star-gazing noddle,
now? A witch, indeed! Who will take thee to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
a wizard for saying so, thou dreaming old owl?
Marry, come up! I say a witch, too!"&mdash;and then
she shook poor Toby till his teeth chattered, and he
would fain have uttered a loud alarm, but durst not
speak, for the life of him.</p>

<p>The dame left him to recover his courage, and
laughed heartily, in spite of some slight feeling of vexation,
as she told the story to her customers during
the day. A few hours served to bring a crowd round
the tailor's dwelling, though none would enter it;
and, till night-fall, Toby's ears were assailed with
epithets which shook his nerves till he wished himself
a thousand miles off, as he afterwards said to Joe.
During the evening, the elder and more influential
members of the little population of Haxey went from
house to house expressing their deep regret for Toby
Lackpenny's lunacy,&mdash;for they decided that he <i>was</i>
lunatic,&mdash;and conjuringly besought the younger and
more frivolous people to desist from persecution of
one who had always been so good and kind-hearted
a neighbour, and was now under a visitation of Providence
that rendered him an object of commiseration
rather than ridicule. And so the victim of imagination
was delivered from the storm of persecution
which he had foreboded would be renewed on the
succeeding day.</p>

<p>Desirous, on her part, of making Toby feel the
value of her neighbourship, Dame Deborah never
crossed his threshold on that day. Toby was thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
left a solitary; and yet his mental disease had not
yet reached a stage that would render solitude curative.
On the contrary, it permitted his prurient
imagination to become more mischievous in its influence.</p>

<p>A neat little dove-cote was a conspicuous rural
adornment to the ancient gable of Dame Deborah's
dwelling; and its cooing habitants were familiarly
acquainted with the tailor's threshold, and even with
his cottage-floor,&mdash;whither they were often attracted
by the crumbs Toby spread upon it, when his favourite
tabby had strayed forth from the cot, and so
could give no alarm to these feathered visitants.
Toby had been reading a full description, during that
solitary morning, in one of his witchery-books, of
the way in which the most powerful of all charms
might be prepared for subjugating a witch or a
wizard; and the entrance of one of Dame Deborah's
pigeons, into his cottage, seemed to give him the
opportunity he coveted of testing the efficacy of the
prescribed charm. He wilily closed his door, and
after a brief struggle, captured the bird,&mdash;which he,
forthwith, secured, by shutting it up in the oaken
corner cupboard, which served him for wardrobe,
larder, and coal-cellar.</p>

<p>The day wore on, and the philosopher, with a
struggle against his misgivings that whispered
"cruelty and barbarity," reckoned mightily on the
triumph his newly acquired knowledge was to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
him over the powers of darkness as soon as night
arrived, and the murky hour of twelve approached.
He sharpened a knife till the edge was most deadly
keen; he made up a good fire: he collected, at least,
one hundred pins from the patches on his shop-board
and in his drawers: he prepared the string by which
the dove's heart was to be hung to roast; and he
drove in the nail to which the string was to be tied.</p>

<p>And now the black midnight hour was near, and
trembling with agitation that might almost be called
horror, Toby Lackpenny took the poor fluttering
pigeon out of its hiding-place, and took the fierce
knife into his hand to be ready to dash into its breast
as soon as the church clock struck the first stroke of
twelve. Need he had for self-possession and preparedness
of mind and act, in order to complete his
necromantic feat like a true adept,&mdash;for although he
was not to wound the bird till he heard the first
stroke of twelve, yet he must have its heart out,
alive, and have it stuck full of pins, and placed down
at the fire to roast,&mdash;and all before the church clock
had told the last stroke of twelve!</p>

<p>"Pshaw!&mdash;nonsense&mdash;what a chicken-hearted
fool I am!" said poor Toby to himself, as he stood
trying to confine the bird's wings with one hand, and
holding his sharp knife in the other: "let me think
of the victory I shall obtain over these agents of the
Evil One,&mdash;and not give way in this childish
manner!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>But Toby <i>did</i> give way, and could not help it;
as he said to Joe when he afterwards described this
strange temptation to his beloved young friend. The
faster the moments flew, and the more nearly the
magical moment approached, the more Toby trembled,
and the more loudly his heart beat against his
ribs, and the more terrifically his conscience menaced
his peace, till&mdash;as the last half minute was elapsing,
he threw down the knife, and releasing the pigeon
from his grasp, declared aloud, though out of the
hearing of every human being, that he neither could
nor would hurt the poor harmless dove, even if all
the witches on earth, and all the fiends they dealt
with in the other place, should, thenceforth, have
power to torment him every minute of his remaining
life.</p>

<p>There was an end of Toby's grand achievement of
power over all the witches and wizards with whom
he believed the Isle of Axholme to be infested!
The hour had passed over, and it was too late&mdash;perhaps,
for ever&mdash;for him to perform the all-potent
immolation,&mdash;since the sacrifice of the same pigeon
would be of no efficacy, after it had been prepared,
and yet remained unslaughtered. His better nature
felt satisfaction at the thought of the pigeon being
still alive, though his superstitious ambition led him
to experience a deep shade of regret that he had
not had hardihood of spirit sufficient to enable him
to grasp the grand ideal prize which was so nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
within his reach. Regrets were useless, however,
he reflected; and so he quenched his blazing fire,
and lay down to rest.</p>

<p>In the morning, a new temptation awaited the
fanatical witch-finder. Forgetting that Tabby could
easily pounce upon the pigeon while left on the
cottage-floor, though she could not get at it in the
cupboard,&mdash;Toby had gone to bed without concerning
himself about the safety of the bird, being so
much absorbed with the feeling of satisfaction that he
had spared its life. No sooner had her master fallen
asleep, however, and the bird placed its bill under
its wing for taking rest, than Tabby slily seized her
prize and butchered it for a secret banquet. Her
bloody mouth and glistening eyes, together with the
scattered feathers, proclaimed her deed, most unmistakeably,
as soon almost as Toby had opened his
eyes and looked round his humble dwelling.</p>

<p>A new conviction sprang into his capricious brain:
Tabby was a witch, self-transfigured into a cat!
There could be no doubt of it&mdash;not the shadow of a
doubt. How strange that he had not marked her
particular habits before!&mdash;and yet, it was a fact,
now he came to think of it,&mdash;that she purred and
squinted, just like the transfigured cat-witches he had
lately read of in his profound, mystical books. As
for the pigeon, she hated it, of course, knowing the
purpose for which it had been brought thither. It
was as clear as the sun at noon,&mdash;though all cats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
liked pigeon flesh if they could get it,&mdash;that Tabby
devoured this pigeon because she was a witch, and
it had been secreted as a forthcoming sacrificial charm
for overthrowing witch-power!</p>

<p>What, then, was the discerning Lackpenny to do,
under this astounding discovery? He resolved to
put an end to Tabby's life, by the peculiar and
effectual mode in which alone a cat-witch could be
destroyed: she must be hung up by the heels over
his cottage-door to die a prolonged but irredeemable
death! Toby shuddered; but he was convinced it
was the only righteous and wise way to be taken,&mdash;and
so he set about carrying it into effect. Tabby
inflicted some vengeful wounds on her old master
while he was in course of tying the cord round her
hind feet, and then hoisting her up over the door,&mdash;but
Toby fulfilled his office of executioner&mdash;thrust on
him by fate and duty, he believed&mdash;very stoutly this
time&mdash;in spite of the aversion he felt at taking away
the life of a dumb creature which had sung "three-thrum"
on his hearth so often, and borne him company
through so many days of poverty, although days
of content. He hung up his cat; but how was he
to stop her cries?</p>

<p>A crowd again gathered round his house, and demanded
that he should release his cat. But Toby
was more resolute that he would not, the more they
insisted on it. Dame Deborah, at length, stepped
from her dwelling, and, cutting the poor animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
loose, broke Toby's counter-enchantment at a stroke.
Then throwing open the tailor's door, and fixing her
eyes upon him very threateningly, she told him she
would certainly help to hang him by the heels,&mdash;if
ever he attempted again to treat his poor harmless
cat in so barbarous a manner.</p>

<p>Toby spake not one word. His recollection of the
fearful shake the aged dame had lately given him,
rendered him apprehensive that she might renew it,
and so he kept prudent silence.</p>

<p>The crowd gradually departed, and left the baffled
philosopher-visionary, once more, to solitary reflection&mdash;but
it was now <i>hungry</i> reflection,&mdash;and proved
to be most effectual in dispelling his wild fancies.
Shame under the keen reproofs of his neighbours,
and failure of his cupboard, contributed to weary
him of his witch notions,&mdash;so that on the following
morning he was fain to receive a little present from
Dame Deborah, with thanks for her kindness.</p>

<p>Gradually, he became so entirely ashamed of his
recent eccentricities that he made earnest apologies
to all whom he had treated with rudeness,&mdash;and all
were so ready to forgive, and so happy to see him
restored to a neighbourly temper,&mdash;that Toby found
it easy to recover his former ease of mind and habitual
good humour.</p>

<p>The longer Toby lived the less likely was it for
one so ardently imaginative by constitution, to sink
into the mere matter-of-fact quietude of thought that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
characterised the majority of his neighbours. On
the contrary, as he grew older, his brain became
more and more prolific of imaginations; but, happily,
they were increasingly of a more pleasing nature
as he increased in years. In spite of all his life-long
dreams and fancies, and in spite of straitness
in his means of living, Toby was a happy
old man; for, with all the startling activity of his
imagination, Toby had never corrupted his bodily
vigour by a single act of intemperance. When Joe
returned to bury his aged foster-mother, Toby walked,
by the help of two sticks, to the grave-side, declaring
that he saw two lovely angels walking before
the coffin, all the way from the dame's door, and
he knew they would come for him next. Whether
the yearning of his desire and imagination, or the
great effort he made to attend the funeral, most
assisted to hasten his end, cannot be said,&mdash;but he
died the very next day,&mdash;with a heaven of smiles on
his aged face,&mdash;and with the words "heaven" and
"angels" on his tongue.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
